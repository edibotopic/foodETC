Food science is an innately *techno-scientific* discipline.
Much of its scientific work is focused on the design or improvement of technology.
Ideally, this technology provides some benefit to society, which supports science and technology through funding.
This virtuous feedback loop is depicted in the animation below.

## General Features of Scientific Knowledge

Philosophers continue to argue over what makes science *special* as a form of human knowledge.
There is general agreement that the following features can be recognised in the scientific process.

- **Falsifiable**: a scientific claim can — in principle — be tested and determined to be false
- **Mechanistic**: scientific facts are justified by reference to testable causal mechanisms
- **Generalisable**: scientific ideas can be applied successfully in different domains
- **Objective**: scientific studies are designed to eliminate the influence of personal bias
- **Inter-subjective**: a scientific work is evaluated (subjectively) by a community of peers who form an (inter-subjective) consensus on its merits 

Note that science ≠ technology.
Scientific knowledge may be applied in the design of technology.
Correct scientific knowledge can be applied to create a dangerous technology (e.g., the nuclear bomb).
This does not mean that the original scientific knowledge was flawed or dangerous (in and of itself).
Technology may be motivated by different reasons and principles than a purely scientific pursuit (e.g., profit).

## Models, Analysis and Synthesis

It is important to distinguish between ontological claims and epistemological claims.

The claim "humans are machines" may be interpreted as ontological, in that it makes suggests that people literally *are* machines.
However, saying that "humans can be thought of as machines" is epistemological, and only means that the machine is a useful model for explaining how humans work.
Consider the video below, which is based on a famous depiction of the human body by a German scientific illustrator named Fritz Kahn.
In it, the body is depicted as a factory with miniature people manning the operations.
Clearly, it would be ridiculous to believe (ontologically) that this was what bodies were actually like.
Yet this familiar and simplistic model can serve a useful explanatory role.

[The human-as-factory model is still alive and well in some food science papers](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1750-3841.13216).
Such a model can be valuable as it simplifies complex systems and improves our ability to study them.
For example, it is difficult (ethically and practically) to do scientific studies with real people;
they may become sick and their lifestyles might influence the results.
For this reason it is difficult to study human digestion.
By modelling human digestion as a factory process, we can design miniature factories in laboratories where
digestion can be studied in a controlled manner, without potentially harming people.
However, we must be careful not to fall into the trap of assuming that people *are* machines (e.g., that they "only need fuel" and that they should "maximise their efficiency").

Scientists are frequently criticised as being "reductionists" by people who claim to be "holists".
However, most good scientists need to consider the whole as well as the parts.
Indeed, they need to consider how the parts interact in the formation of the whole.
This is what scientists usually mean by the "structure" of the systems they study.
Consider the video above again — the human body is not depicted as a collection of parts operating independently; instead,
the various sub-systems (gastrointestinal, respiratory, circulatory, etc.) work together in the system of the human body.

## The Sciences of Food

Food is studied by a variety of disciplines inside, outside and adjacent to food science.
There are food scientists, but also food geographers and food historians.
Even within the sciences there are a variety of disciplines, including:

- Food science
- Nutritional science
- Molecular gastronomy
- Gastrophysics

It is difficult to make a total separation between these disciplines.
Food scientists study nutritional science during their degrees.
Some go on to work with products that have primarily a nutritional function (e.g., infant formula).
Nutritional scientists study food science during their degrees.
Some go on to work in technical roles that are commonly occupied by food scientists (e.g., quality control).
The difference is really a matter of emphasis: food scientists devote more of their time on the systematic study of food processing, food structure and food chemistry, and have a broad conception of "food function" that encompasses nutrition but also other factors (e.g., convenience, taste, texture).
Nutritional scientists place a greater emphasis on the systematic study of the body and the manner in which nutrients are processed physiologically, as well as the population-wide trends in the consumption of specific nutrients and how this might be linked with health conditions.
These two types of scientist have significant overlaps in their knowledge but must specialise in some different topics to support their research.
Food scientists, for example, must understand the link between processing and nutritional quality of food, so they study more physics and engineering.
Nutritional scientists, for example, have to study large datasets from populations, so they study more statistics, and a selection of them go on to further study to work as dieticians, so they also learn about clinical topics.
Often they must work together (in universities or in companies) in order to fill in the gaps in their knowledge.

Occasionally, scientists consider an existing discipline to have ignore or downplayed an important topic, which they suggest warrants the creation of a new discipline.
This was the case with molecular gastronomy, created by the scientists Nicholas Kurti and Herve This, who felt that food science has paid insufficient attention to cooking.
Molecular gastronomy is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of food science and shares many of its methods and principles.
The more recently developed gastrophysics was proposed by the psychologist Charles Spence, and has highlighted how food experiences are influenced by psychological factors and the context of the experience.
Gastrophysics is closely related to sensory science, a long-standing sub-discipline of food science but which has less emphasis on psychological concepts.
Many of these disciplines are "sub-disciplines" insofar as they study a sub-set of problems within food science.
In set-theoretic language, food science is then the "power set" (the set of all those sub-sets).

One of the goals of molecular gastronomy was to make cooking a more scientific process.
To achieve this one of its methods of investigation was to study recipes and attempt to explain scientifically steps in the recipe that were imprecise or vague.
Herve This, one of its co-founders, even proposed a kind of language that can be used as a tool to automate the generation of recipes.
We will discuss this language in the next lecture on food structure.
