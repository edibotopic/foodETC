There are different ways to approach knowing something.

Approaching food like a scientist, a designer or a craftsperson are all different modes of thinking.

Consider the factors that consumers deem important when purchasing a food product:

<div style="display: table margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto"> <!-- TODO: add to CSS -->

```{ojs}

factors = [
  {importance: 85, factor: "taste"},
  {importance: 65, factor: "price"},
  {importance: 62, factor: "health"},
  {importance: 49, factor: "convenience"},
  {importance: 37, factor: "sustainability"}
]

Plot.plot({
  y: {domain: [0,100], label: "Importance (%)"},
  x: {label: ""},

  marks: [
    Plot.barY(factors, {y: "importance", x: "factor", fill: d => d.importance}),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]

})

```

Health is but one aspect of this picture, and nutrition is just one aspect of health.

## Operationalisation

When confronted with an ontological concept that is not immediately testable we have two choices:

1. Reject the concept
2. operationalise the concept

For example, if someone argues that unicorns might be healthier meat source than chickens we should probably reject the concept.
This is certainly a view not generally held by people and it is difficult to imagine how we might use an imaginary animal as a raw material.
Now, a concept like "natural food" is viewed by some scientist as being equally as meaningless.
In their view, as all things are ultimately derived from nature, it does not make sense to talk of degrees of naturalness.
However, the concept is widely used in society and is not necessarily imaginary in the sense of a unicorn.
The problem is not whether natural things are real but is instead:

1. How can things be categorised as natural?
2. What benefit is there to this categorisation?

These questions **operationalise** the problem and make it more **tractable**.

## Operationalisation of AI

A famous case of operationaliation is the Turing Test.

When Alan Turing proposed his test it was after many years of debates concerning the question:

> Can machines think?

While Turing thought this was an interesting question he did not think it could be resolved.

In other words: it was a waste of time.
his test, on the other hand, was tractable:

> Can a machine convince someone that it is a person?
