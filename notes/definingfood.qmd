## Main Concepts 

- **Ontology**: the abstract study of systems of objects and their relations
- **System**: a dynamic set of objects and their relations that forms a coherent structure with emergent properties
- **Ontological assumption**: an ontological belief that is held uncritically and influences judgements about reality 
- **Technology**: a system designed by people to serve a function, usually with the aid of scientific knowledge
:::

Historically, the creation of new knowledge about food has made important contributions to human development.
The harnessing of fire in cooking has even been claimed to be a critical moment in the growth of the human brain (Wrangham, 2009).
Early developments in preservation, such as salting and smoking, alleviated the survival pressure to continuously find new food.
As societies shift from a context new york article of food scarcity to one of food abundance, there can be increased opportunities to focus on other activities, including leisure, creativity and study.
This story is a tale of *progress* but some have argued that problems such as obesity are evidence that we are going backwards.
Despite the fact that we all eat, there is not universal agreement on what *is* food, what is *good* food and what might *become* food.

Professional food scientists work on a variety of product types.
Something like whiskey is not what most people would characterise as "food" due to its limited nutritional value, yet food scientists do study whiskey.
Whiskies have other qualities that are valued by people who consume them (e.g., aroma richness, colour intensity, alcohol content).
They must be processed in a very controlled way using operations like distillation to ensure they are safe and consistent.
Whiskey and a protein supplement are both studied by food scientists but they have completely different functions.
While the supplement has a greater nutritional value it is itself difficult to characterise as "food" given that it is by definition *supplementary* to a diet consisting largely of food.
If we put aside whether these materials are food and just consider that food scientists are interested in "things that are consumed" we run into the problem of distinguishing foods from drugs.
Indeed, while the food and pharmaceutical industries are distinct there is increasing overlap in some their products, especially considering the emphasis now placed on the biological function of food products and ingredients.

Not only is food difficult to define, but what we consider food tends to change.
With the introduction of new technologies — like 3D printing — and new ingredients — like insect protein — our concept of food is continuously challenged.
While scientists and engineers tend to be `utopian` in their attitude and imagine that all technological development will result in societal progress.
Others are `dystopian` in their outlook, imagining a future in which technology has damaged society and the planet.
Dystopianism often coexists with a `romantic` vision of the past, a time before technology when things were better.
Before adopting such a philosophy we should try to consider what it means for something to be food.

We start by considering questions like this in the most general terms possible.

# What Food Is

There are generally two approaches to beginning a discussion of *what food is*.
In science education, there is a tendency to begin with `parts` (elements, atoms and molecules).
In everyday life we are more likely to begin with `wholes` (qualities, appearance, emotions).
Both approaches are legitimate but they often seem to be in conflict:

> Science tells us to choose foods based on nutrients but we should really be trusting our instincts
> — a common view among figures like Michael Pollan, who have critiqued the food industry in recent years

There is another way of talking about food that focuses on `categories`.
A significant number of people think it is 'common sense' to opt for **natural** food.
This is assumed to exist in *opposition* to another category of the **artificial**.
If we consider concepts like ’naturalness’, ’wholeness’ and ’cleanness’ to be important
then we should understand *what they mean* and *why they are important*, as this will make errors in judgement less likely.

We must first recognise — however — that the process of thinking about these categories is **not science**.
This does not mean that the process is not important, but simply that it must be approached in a different way.
Thus, instead of doing experiments we have to reason carefully about the ideas and how they are related.

Whenever we think about food, identify foods and eat foods we have some *implicit* assumption concerning *what food is*.
These assumptions can have an impact on our health, the environment and the economy.
*Ontology* is a deliberate attempt to probe such assumptions, and can help make our assumptions *explicit* (Kaplan, 2012: 3).
Once they are explicit we can question them and — if necessary — challenge them.

## Parts and Wholes

Any system can be described in terms of parts and wholes:

- A classroom is a whole consisting of a teacher and students
- A kitchen mixer is a whole consisting of a motor, shaft and paddle
- A salad is a whole consisting of (typically) cold ingredients and dressing

::: {.callout}
If I brought a kitchen mixer into the classroom to do a demonstration then the mixer would be a **sub-system** in the classroom.
Two friends who begin to ignore the lecture and begin their own conversation also form a sub-system, and so on.
:::

When describing the `structure` of a system we are interested in the *relations* between the parts.
A relation is just some way that two or more parts form a connection (physically or conceptually).
For example, a teacher and a student can be described according to the following relation (in block capitals):

> teacher TEACHES student

A motor and shaft in a mixer:

> motor DRIVES shaft

A salad as:

> dressing COATS ingredients

An egg is:

> liquid INSIDE shell

It is always possible to develop a new *model* for our system.
Consider the classroom example, which assumes one-way communication between teacher and student.
Below we have a more complex model, describing a case in which `student A` attends class and is taught by the `teacher`.
The communication is bidirectional, because the student asks and answers questions.
`Student B` did not attend class, so relies on what the other student tells them about the class.

```{dot}
digraph G {
  layout=neato
  teacher -> "student A"
  "student A" -> teacher
  "student A" -> "student B"
}
```

::: {.callout}

## Models

Models are representations of reality used to frame a set of problems so that they can be studied.

:::

It is common for thinkers to consider two ways of approaching the study of such systems:

- **Holism**: things should be understood by studying the thing as a whole
- **Reductionism** (or 'individualism'): things should be understood by studying their individual parts

Reductionism is commonly associated with scientific thinking, which — we will see — is somewhat of a simplification.
The reason for this is that good scientific explanations do not only consider parts, but also how parts relate with each other and the whole in question (through interactions, mechanisms and so on).
In this way science is *systematic*.

::: {.callout}

## Systemism

An approach to studying the world that considers the mechanisms by which parts interact as wholes within a given environment.

Note that the environment (or context) is critical: ingredients behave differently in different media; foods are tolerated more or less well by different individuals; diets can be more or less successful for different lifestyles.
:::

Advocates of holism commonly consider that important properties of wholes *emerge* in a manner that is not explainable by reference to their parts.
This often leads to assumptions that certain properties are — in effect — mysterious and unexplainable.
As a result, holism is often an unscientific position, as it asserts that there are real, important things that cannot be investigated or understood.

A food scientist is interested in the qualities that wholes have (is this food product enjoyable?) as well as the mechanisms by which parts determine these qualities (what molecules are associated with this enjoyment?).
Food scientists therefore operate at and between two levels:

- **Macro:** the qualities that can be experienced and observed
- **Micro:** the parts and interactions that culminate in qualities

This concept will be covered in more detail in the `Epistemology` lectures.

::: {.callout-note}

## Emergence

Emergence is an ontological concept that suggests that a set of parts when combined can produce a whole with properties not possessed by any of the parts.

For example, a $H_2O$ molecule does not have the property of *viscosity* (resistance to flowing) but when millions of these molecules are combined into a liquid that liquid is observed to have viscosity.

Similarly, one person does not have the property of *social cohesion*, but citizens in a country do have social cohesion when operating as a group of people.

Emergence is sometimes argued to make reductionism (and science) insufficient to explain reality; however, scientists do not deny emergence and do not attempt to explain emergent properties solely by reference to parts.

Scientists and holists agree that certain qualities seem to "emerge".
The difference is that in science it is assumed that there is an explanation (it may just not have been discovered yet) while in holism it is often assumed that no such explanation can be found.

### Boundaries and Levels

<div title="click and drag nodes to rearrange the graph" id="observablehq-chart-7fb96fb1">

<strong>Fig. 1.</strong><p>Examples of some different ways to "reduce" food <a href="https://observablehq.com/d/dc3dc8d5798f99dd">(original source here)</a></p>
</div>

When working on anything we usually operate within some constraints (e.g., time, money).
To make progress we often need to draw a *boundary* around the (sub)system that interests us.
In the diagram above, we can imagine cutting the blue line so that the rest falls away and we only have to think about nutrients.

We could then draw a boundary around the macronutrients of food, proteins (P), sugars (S) and lipids (L).
In symbols this could be written:

$$Food = \{P,S,L\}$$

This, however, is quite limited, as food also contains micronutrients, like vitamins (V) and minerals (M):

$$Food = \{[P,C,L],[V,M]\}$$

Food also contains taste (T), flavour (F) and aroma (A) molecules:

$$Food = \{[P,C,L],[V,M],[T,F,A]\}$$

::: {.callout-tip}

## The Meaning of these Symbols

These type of equations might be familiar to you from *set theory*, which everyone studies in school.

Food can be defined as a set of elements (elements meaning *elements of a set* rather than *chemical element*).

Thinking strictly in nutritional terms:

$$Food = \{[P,C,L],[V,M]\}$$

This means there are two subsets (inside the square brackets) — micronutrients ($Mi$) for the first subset and macronutrients ($Ma$) for the second.
We can then define the nutritional composition of food ($F_n$) as the union of these subsets:

$$F_n = Mi \cup Ma$$

Now assume that we have similar definitions for the structural elements of food ($Fs$), the psychological elements of food ($Fp$), the economic elements of food ($Fe$) and so on (...), we can then define food ($F$) as:

$$F = \{Fn,Fs,Fp,Fe,...\}$$

**You do not have to learn these equations and I will not examine your ability to understand them. I use them because they allow complex ideas to be expressed in a single line and are useful tools to order my thinking (you might find it useful too).**

:::

Much of the science of food can be subsumed under *chemistry* but — as discussed in class — we can include different aspects of food in our analysis when thinking in terms of *physics* and *biology*.
For example, in class I mentioned how we can consider *bread* in terms of its chemical composition (what is its gluten content?), its physical properties (how elastic is it?) but also the biological mechanisms that give it structure (which yeast content will generate the optimal fermentation?).

For a moment, let's think bigger, and imagine a food product in a supermarket:

- The food has a chemical composition
- The food has an appearance, perceived by the shopper
- The food has a format and package, influencing how it can be used
- The food has a price, which the shopper must be willing to pay
- The food has competitors that may be more or less preferred
- The food might have a health claim and this could be true or false
- The food has been manufactured and transported, giving it an environmental footprint

Consider a case where a consumer sees a product in a shop and considers buying it.
The product has been manufactured in an environmentally-friendly way and is rich in a variety of nutrients.
However, they recently spoke to their friend who heard a news story about that product causing a case of food poisoning.
The consumer does not buy the product because of the perceived risk, even if it meets other criteria (e.g., nutritional quality, environmental sustainability).

```{dot}
digraph G {
  food -> "shopper A" 
  "shopper B" -> "shopper A"
  "shopper A" -> "shopper B"
  "news story" -> "shopper B"
  "safety risk" -> "news story"
  food -> "safety risk"
}
```

To fully understand food *as a system*, and as a sub-system interacting with other sub-systems, we often need to consider multiple factors.
As our time and resources are limited we sometimes need to draw a boundary around a smaller set of things in order to — basically — *get work done*.
However, when we do this we must not forget that a boundary has been drawn (the map is not the territory).

::: {.callout-important}

## Levels of Analysis: The Map is Not the Territory

If food scientists are confronted with a problem that involves particles that sink in a beverage to form a sediment, they may restrict their analysis to:

- **Whole:** suspension of solid particles in liquid
- **Parts:** solid particles, surrounding liquid

They can then develop a physical solution to the problem: making the particles smaller so that they sink more slowly.

In this case there is no advantage to studying the system at a finer scale (molecules) or a larger scale (supermarket).
However, the nature of this analysis does not mean that the scientist denies the existence of molecules or supermarkets!
:::

There is a sense in which food is a collection of chemicals, a sense in which it is a physical system, a sense in which it is an economic commodity, and a sense in which it is a source of nutrients for human growth, and a sense in which it is an object of desire.
All of these ways of categorising food can be useful.
Because we are in a university classroom we have the luxury of *thinking big* so that we can develop a complex understanding of food.
The mathematician Eugenia Cheng in a talk at Google gives an excellent example of `thinking in systematic terms` about the phenomenon of gaining weight (the video will start at the correct mark):

## Reductionism Involves Small Boundaries, Not Small Components

Reductionism is often associated with thinking in terms of physically small things (atoms, molecules, gears).
It might be suggested that it is reductionist to talk about molecules and we should instead focus on the environment.
Molecules are small, the environment is big and the environment contains molecules.
The assumption is that if we focus on studying the bigger thing then we will understand the system fully.

However, a strict focus on molecules and a strict focus on the environment **both** "reduce" our thinking.
By drawing a boundary around observable things in the environment we restrict ourselves to a surface-level understanding.
By drawing a boundary around microscopic things we lose sight of how they make important contributions to the environment.

Waste from a factory can pollute a river which can be observed to decrease the population of fish.
However, it is often the high level of phosphorus in these wastes that causes eutrophication, promoting the growth of algae and — in turn — depleting oxygen that the fish need to survive. 

Understanding the underlying (micro-level) events helps us identify the cause of the (macro-level) problem and develop strategies to prevent its occurrence (not every waste is phosphorus-rich).

:::

## Seeking a definition

When asked to define an object as seemingly *everyday* as food many are quick to consult a dictionary.
Here, we will generally find something like:

> a material containing nutrients that when consumed provides an organism with the means to grow

Is this a good definition? Most intuitively answer 'yes'.
However, when asked to describe favourite foods people will mention things like:

- Sensory attributes (taste, aroma, flavour, texture, sound)
- Contextual factors (sharing food, celebrating with food, food as a reward)
- Ingredient pairings (chocolate with caramel, cheese with crackers, beer with chips)
- Functional properties (muscle building, weight loss, skin health, life extension)

Earlier I indicated that scientists focus on parts while non-scientists focus on wholes — this is a simplification that we will need to revisit.
In fact, scientists are interested in wholes (or the qualities that wholes are observed to have) but in the following specific ways:

- What causes certain qualities?
- Which qualities do people prefer?
- How can qualities be measured?

**Note:** while qualities like redness and sweetness are `subjective` this does not mean that scientists are not interested in them.
In fact, as the consumption of food is driven to a great extent by subjective factors, food scientists are greatly interested in these properties.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Tip: don't rely on a dictionary

Dictionaries provide definitions for the *common usage* of terms in an **everyday** context.

The meaning of a word can change over time.
At a given time a word might have an imprecise meaning, or even multiple possible meanings.
Some individuals may have a more detailed understanding of a term by --- for example --- being experts on a topic.

You are in university to develop a deeper knowledge of food than most people.
People argue about food in spite of the existence of dictionary definitions.
These issues are not settled and we need to think about them carefully.
:::

Consider the claim:

> food is a collection of nutrients

In most cases, food necessarily contains a significant quantity of nutrients.
However, it is not the case that food **only** contains nutrients.
The primary constituent of most foods is `water`, nearly all foods contain `bacteria` and there is a broad class of other `non-nutritional factors` (e.g., fibres) that can be studied.
Any food scientist that neglects the role of water, bacteria and fibre in food and diet is not doing their job well!

::: {.callout}

## Water

Food scientists spend a lot of time studying and manipulating water in food systems.
The amount of water in a food is critical in determining the time it takes to rot.
The presence of water in specific forms — like crystals — is also important for the texture of products like ice-cream.
Nutritionally, a significant proportion of our water intake is in the form of food.
:::

Think about ice-cream for a moment.
Why do people buy ice-cream?
Usually because they enjoy certain qualities (coldness, melting, sweetness, texture).
When is ice-cream frequently served?
*After* a meal (not *as* the meal).

Not all food is like ice-cream, in which nutrition is often a secondary consideration.
Some foods — like infant formula — can be considered to serve primarily a nutritional function. However, most foods are selected for a wide variety of reasons (nutrition, sensory, culture, etc.).
Narrowing our definition of food to a single class of molecules (nutrients) or properties (taste) leads to a limited understanding of food and reduces our capacity to design foods for different individuals and contexts.

::: {.callout-note}

## Base Needs

In primary school most of us encountered the distinction between *needs* and *wants*.
Food is often considered a *need*, like water, rather than a *want* like a VR headset.
As food is needed for survival, this can lead to the view that as long as a food contributes to survival it is good.

Now consider some other "base needs" like clothes and shelter.
Certainly, both jackets and houses protect us from our environments.
However, think about the actual place where you live or the outfit that you are wearing.
Do you think what makes these things "good" is solely determined by their capacity to protect you from the environment?
When you think of how your apartment could be better or what shoes you might prefer are you thinking:

> How will this maximise my capacity to survive in my environment?

The answer is surely 'no' because — living in a safe, rich country — your survival is effectively ensured.
Given that most (though not all) people in a country like Ireland have an adequate supply of nutrients the 
question is rarely 'how will I have enough food to survive?' but rather 'what foods do I most desire?'.

:::

## Nutraloaf

In class we encountered [Nutraloaf](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/01/02/256605441/punishing-inmates-with-the-loaf-persists-in-the-u-s), a meal fed to prisoners as punishment.
From how it is described, the food is claimed to be nutritionally complete.
However, the food is otherwise bland.

Nutraloaf has been the subject of legal cases in the USA that argue it is a Cruel and Unusual punishment.
While many of these lawsuits have been unsuccessful the practice of feeding prisoners "punishment meals" has been outlawed in some US states.
The issue is interesting because Nutraloaf apparently serves the basic function of a food (supplying nutrients), while obviously being a very controversial subject.

Ontologically, this material seems to meet the necessary conditions for being a food but it is also in some sense inadequate.

Consider the following, which will also be discussed in class:

- A food can only be successful in supplying nutrients insofar as it is deemed edible and can be eaten
- The phenomenon of 'taste fatigue' is not restricted to prisoners and is known to cause nutritional deficiencies in other people in society, which is considered a problem
- The idea that a single nutritionally complete food can be prepared for all adult males is scientifically dubious
- Perceived risk is a major factor determining the decision of individuals to eat and drink substances

::: {.callout-tip}

## Questions

What do you think about nutraloaf?

Would you eat it?

Do you think it's fair that others have to?

How is it different to commercial meal-replacers like Soylent?
:::

## Ontology

We are seeking **general** ideas about food rather than particular ones.
If we started listing all of the particularities of different foods, such as redness, freshness, spiciness
then we would have a very long list.
We would throw our hands up at some point and say 'it's complicated'.
When doing ontology we aim for more general ideas.
Redness and spiciness are *sensory properties*.
Foods possess those properties and they can be sensed.
Freshness is also a property, but its meaning is less clear (can you think of how it would be sensed?).
We could categorise the different kinds of properties that foods have and any properties (like freshness) that seem ill-defined.
This would be *doing ontology*, but the clarity it would provide can help us *do science* (how will we measure freshness?).

::: {.callout-tip}

## Objects and Relations

As an abstract study, ontology can be applied to many different cases:

- A family is a set of people (objects) with an ancestry and/or affinity (relations)
- A meal consists of a combination of ingredients (objects) that are edible to people (relation)
- A sentence consists of characters (objects) that can be combined according to syntax rules (relation)
- A mathematical formula consists of symbols like numbers (objects) and operators like addition (relations)
- A diet consists of quantities of specific foods (objects) that satisfy some dietary goals (relations)

The definitions above have been *stipulated* by me and you might disagree.
For example, you might think that a better account of a meal would include:

- Additional objects (cutlery, plates, courses, drinks, dinner guests, the price)
- Additional relations (order of courses, food-drink pairings, comfort with setting, familiarity between people)

When doing ontology it is possible (in theory) to reach for a full account of a system.
Often in science we must draw a boundary somewhere to make the problem tractable.
:::

Ontology is similar to mathematics in that it involves the abstract study of objects.
When doing ontology, however, we usually try to determine what we can say about reality.
For most mathematicians, talking about sets or numbers does not mean that these objects exist physically.
Mathematics is neutral with respect to reality and is only concerned with mathematical objects.

At a very basic level ontology concerns two kinds of thing:

1. Objects
2. Relations

From these simple types of things we can reason about a lot, including structures and systems.
The question *what is an emulsion?* is answered by considering the objects (oil and water) and the relations (the oil is dispersed in the water).
An emulsion is a structure that is defined as a dispersion of oil and water.
This structure has important properties — it can dissolve both water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, for example.

::: {.callout-important}

## Taxonomies and Food Pyramids

A *taxonomy* that you encounter in biology is a kind of ontological model.
Typically, a [taxonomy](https://www.britannica.com/science/taxonomy) classifies objects into a hierarchy.
This means between any two objects there is an order ($x$ is either higher or lower than $y$).
In a biological taxonomy the highest level (or 'rank') is the most general while the lowest is the least general.
Plants and animals share general attributes of Life, but a red fox and a white rose have different attributes as different Species.

The traditional [food pyramid](https://www.safefood.net/healthy-eating/guidelines/food-pyramid) is an ontology of this kind — but objects at the lowest level (fruits, veg) are considered more foundational to the diet.
A less common type of model is a *meronomy*, which classifies objects on the basis of parthood.
[MyPlate](https://www.myplate.gov/), a replacement for the food pyramid, consists of a meal (the whole) and its parts (fruits, grains, veg, protein, dairy).
This model attempts to establish what the necessary components should be for every meal.
Revisions to the food pyramid have taken place multiple times over the decades.
There continues to be debate over this issue because people disagree over what factors are important when categorising food.
For example, increasingly there are calls to include environmental impact in such classifications.
:::

A structure is simply a set of objects and the relations that hold between them.
Meals have a structure because some courses (main) follow other courses (starter).
A university class has a structure because some person (lecturer) teaches other people (students).
Systems are structures that are dynamic (they change over time).
For simplicity, we often think of systems as fixed (into systems) but most are in flux.
At any point there can be a strong market demand for a particular food product, but this level of demand is subject to change based on a variety of factors (trends, wars, pandemics).

::: {.callout-note}

## Person Wants Food, Person Eats Food, Person Is Nourished

A possible issue in the nutraloaf case is that the relation between the food and the prisoner is not considered seriously.
The food is nutritionally complete (for argument's sake) but many prisoners do not want to eat it.
Defending nutraloaf on the basis that it provides nutrients does not account for the fact that people need to first desire foods in order to then acquire their nutrients.
For nutraloaf to function as a food it must also be acceptable to prisoners (it evidently is not).

The idea is that the punishment works by depriving the prisoner of enjoyment (sensory blandness) while ensuring they remain healthy (nutritional completeness).
However, enjoying food and being nourished by food are tightly coupled (we eat the things we want to eat).
We could therefore say:

> A food is nourishing if it has a high nutritional quality and is considered desirable to eat

:::

In recent times, food scientists have needed to expand the boundaries of the systems they study, especially in the context of sustainability.
Previously, a food manufacturer may have simply considered how their raw materials can be converted into products and the profits that can be made from their sale.
Today, the manufacturer may need to consider the conditions for the workers that produce the raw materials, the environmental impact of their factory and the health impact of their products.
In this way, the ontology of the food scientist has expanded, and they now consider a broader range of objects, relations and structures in their work.

::: {.callout-warning}

It is always wise to question our ontological models.
Since ancient times thinkers have constructed taxonomies that suggest men are "higher beings" than women.
These false ontological models can have negative practical consequences (e.g., the right to vote).

While less immediately controversial, the designers of MyPlate's decision to distinguish "protein" as a type of food
(it is normally considered as a nutrient) from other types (conventional types like fruit) should attract
our attention:

> what is "protein" supposed to represent as a food group?

> why are "oils" not represented?

Other more recently-developed types of food — like convenience food — have escaped easy definitions.
Convenience food is often considered to be unhealthy but Jackson et al. (2018: 223) give the example of meal kits, which are convenient for people who want to minimise time spent shopping or planning for their meal while having contents that would normally be called "convenience foods". 

:::

## Naturalness

In the case of food, asking 'what is a natural food?' does not have an obvious scientific answer.
It is a matter of how we 'carve up' the world into categories so we can mentally process the complexity of the world.
This involves ontological reasoning that is implicit (done unconsciously and assumed to be true without question):

- There are natural things and artificial things (ontological categorisation)
- People are separate from nature (ontological assumption)
- Artificial things are made by people (ontological definition)

Assuming this is true, many of the things that we value are artificial (furniture, houses, clothing, careers, education, meals).
Most people use words like 'natural' and 'artificial' to describe the world.
It is useful, for example, to look at an unspoiled beach and say it is 'natural' and a skate park and say it is 'artificial', if we are in the business of preserving beaches.
Some problems can arise, however, when the distinction is used as a basis to make judgements about what is good and bad.
This is because both categories are sufficiently broad that they each encompasses good and bad things (This, 2014):

- Natural and good: the alcoholic drink known as 'wine' that is generated when grapes are allowed to ferment
- Natural and bad: the anion oxalate that forms a variety of salts in plant-based foods and is associated with gout and kidney stones
- Artificial and good: synthetic vanillin used in the production of 99% of the world's vanilla-flavoured products
- Artificial and bad: *trans* fats produced by the industrial process of hydrogenation that is known to have negative health effects

The assumption that natural things are always good (or bad) is false but so is the assumption that artificial things are always bad (or good).
It is preferable therefore in all such cases to <u>be more precise</u>.
For example, the following statement is productive:

> *trans* fats are bad because of their role in contributing to poor cardiovascular health

However, the next one is overly general and misleading:

> people should avoid all artificial foods because they are bad for your health


### Operationalisation

We have already seen that ontological concepts like 'naturalness' are not scientific.
What this means is that they do not emerge from doing science and they are not testable scientifically.
Nonetheless, it is not uncommon to hear scientists refer to such concepts.

In biomimetics it is assumed that there are natural structures that have specific properties that can be useful.
Scientists can then study them and design nature-inspired materials that benefit from these useful properties.
For example, given the problem of designing a meat-replacer we can first study the structure of meat so that the structure can be replicated.

This is an example of operationalisation, where an abstract concept is made more testable or actionable.
Here, scientists are not concerned with the (philosophical) question of whether natural things exist.
They also do not make the universal (ontological) claim that natural things are better. 
Instead, the category of natural things is assumed to exist, some of those things are studied to determine their properties and attempts are made to recreate those useful properties in artificial systems.

Note: in such cases it might be useful to start with an abstract idea, as long as it can be transformed into a more concrete one.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Is Anything Natural?

The distinction between natural and artificial is rarely clear-cut.

Consider this example (Bunge, 2003):

seed → seedling → sapling → tree → log → pulp → paper → book

This is a combination of a natural and an artificial process.
Given that the seed may have been purposefully planted and its environment manipulated to promote its growth, there is a also a question as to whether the entire process is artificial.

# Conclusions

- A food is a set of components that exist in a structure
- Most food that is consumed has been prepared to benefit humans
- The choice to consume a food is influenced by personal needs and desires, as well as social and cultural factors
- Not every question about food can be resolved scientifically (e.g., ontological questions, ethical problems, design aesthetics)
- Reductionists think of a thing is the set of its parts, holists consider wholes as primary and systemists consider systems comprised of parts that form structures 
- Ontological reductionism is rarely a feature of how scientists think (this is a common misconception)
