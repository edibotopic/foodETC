## Important Concepts 

- **Meal-replacer**: a food or beverage that is claimed to serve the function of replacing traditional meals in the diet 
- **Calories**: a measure of the energy density of nutrients 
- **Atwater factors**: conversion factors that allow scientists to convert between grams of a nutrient and their calorie content 
- **Label claim**: a claim on the label of a food product that relates to nutritional content and/or a positive health impact 
- **Food First**: an approach in managing diets that emphasises regular food or the supplementation of regular food rather than its replacement
- **Oral Nutritional Supplement**: beverages designed to supply nutrients in specific medical contexts
- **Taste Fatigue**: a tendency for individuals to become psychologically bored of something they must consume regularly

*Can food be replaced?*

If it *can* be replaced, what properties must be re-created for a replacement to be effective?

These questions have been provoked by products like **Soylent**, a product claimed to replace food when drank multiple times per day.

An even more controversial case is **Nutraloaf**, a meal (not a commercial product) prepared for prisoners in some US prisons as a punishment for bad behaviour.

Consider these cases *critically*.
In each case, what arguments can be made to defend or critique their use?
How do we determine if a single food is "nutritionally complete" and is nutritional completeness sufficient for something to be a *good* food?

:::{.callout-important}
## Thinking Critically

Thinking *critically* is not the same as *criticising*.

*Critical thinking* usually means reasoning carefully about an idea or topic so that you can justify a specific conclusion on the matter.
This contrasts with *memorisation*, where you (uncritically) recall ideas that have been given to you.
It also contrasts with (uncritically) stating an *opinion*, where a justification for the opinion is typically lacking. 

One of the major goals of a university education is learning to think for yourself.
When approaching a difficult or challenging topic you might:

- Introduce the topic under consideration
- Determine what is at stake — why does it matter?
- Outline arguments for/against specific viewpoints 
- Provide and evaluate evidence (where available)
- Identify weak arguments, find stronger arguments or make your own arguments 

:::

## Nutritional Completeness 

Consider the question of what it means for something to be "nutritionally complete".
In the interactive example below you can adjust the level of the major macronutrients in a model food.
Depending on the serving size, this will generate a specific calorie content.
One of the most simplistic ways of conceiving of food is that is a *source of calories*.

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
// Atwater factors
proFac = 4
lipidFac = 9
sugarFac = 4


md`---`
viewof protein = Inputs.range([0,12], {label: "protein (g)", step: 1, value: randomNumber(1,10)})
viewof lipids = Inputs.range([0,12], {label: "lipids (g)", step: 1, value: randomNumber(1,10)})
viewof sugar = Inputs.range([0,12], {label: "sugars (g)", step: 1, value: randomNumber(1,10)})

viewof servingSize = Inputs.range([100,500], {label: "Serving (g)", step: 50, value: 100})

totalCalories = servingSize * (protein/100*proFac + lipids/100*lipidFac + sugar/100*sugarFac)
md`---`
md`**Total calories** = ${totalCalories.toLocaleString("en")}.`

```

:::{.callout-important collapse="true"}
## Expand for some observations

- Food has a caloric content but this does not fully describe food
- Each macro-nutrient contributes calories, and the total calories is contributed by all of these nutrients
- It is possible to create different foods with the same calorie content but different ratios of the nutrients
- Eating a lot of a low-calorie food might lead to a high calorie intake, eating a little of a high-calorie food might lead to a high calorie intake
- Many important things that we ingest in food have a minimal calories content 

To state that *food is merely calories* is reductionist.
Taking this approach to diet is potentially dangerous.
However, how many people genuinely believe this?

:::


### How is total calories calculated?

Atwater factors represent the calories per gram of each nutrient.

| Nutrient | Factor    |
|--------- | :-------: |
| Protein  | 4         |
| Lipids   | 9         |
| Sugars   | 4         |

To determine the calories contributed by a nutrient in a food you simply multiply the grams of nutrient by the corresponding Atwater factor.

For example, milk contains $3.2\%$ protein.
This is the same as $3.2 g/100 mL$ milk.
If you drink 100 grams of milk the protein will contribute:

$$3.2 \times 4 = 12.8 \ calories \ from \ protein$$

However, calories are also contributed by *sugars* and *lipids*.

The corresponding calculations are:

$$3.5 \times 9 = 31.5 \ calories \ from \ lipids$$
$$4.8 \times 4 = 19.2 \ calories \ from \ sugars$$

To get the total you simply add the individual values together:

$$12.8 + 31.5 + 19.2 = 63.5$$

If you are interested in different serving sizes you need to divide by $100$ (to get the calories per $1 \ g$) and multiply by the desired serving size ($S$):

$$\frac{63.5}{100} \times S = ?$$

Many label claims like "a source of protein" require nutrients like protein to exceed a specific threshold value for either the proportion of calories they contribute.
To say a food is a "source of protein" the protein calories need be 12% of the total calories.

### What would a meal replacement need to achieve?

Assuming we are targeting a well-defined demographic (for example: an athletic woman of healthy weight in her twenties), what would a meal-replacer need to do in order to be successful.
The first reasonable thing to think about is:

- Provision of sufficient calories and nutrients

::: {.callout}
There are at least two difficulties with this goal.
Firstly, nutritional science is not *finished* with its work.
While much is known about the necessary components of a healthy diet scientists continue to discover new components.
Consider that the impact of plant-derived molecules like polyphenols and bacteria that contribute to the gut microflora are still being investigated.
For these reasons, most dieticians recommend a balanced diet where nutrients (known and unknown) are consumed from a variety of sources.
The same dieticians would typically only recommend meal-replacers in specific contexts (illness). 
As is often the case, context is key.
*The context in which Nutraloaf (punishing prisoners), Soylent (boosting productivity) and Ensure (maintaining nutrient intake during illness) are used are all very different.*

Secondly, it can be technologically difficult to incorporate nutrients and other molecules effectively into processed food systems.
For example, beverage manufacturers often have issues when adding calcium, as calcium ions can destabilise proteins and lipids during thermal processes designed to make the product safe.
For this reason insoluble calcium salts are sometimes used, but these are prone to sedimenting from the beverage, which can result in losses of calcium during the process.
These difficulties are not insurmountable but they exist in multiple forms.

One last thing to consider is the role of food structure in determining food digestion.
This is a topic that has been studied to a greater extent by food scientists than nutritional scientists in recent years.
The question is:

> Given two food products A and B with the same nutritional content but different food structure could the rate and extent of nutrient absorption be affected by the structure of each food? 

The answer from recent research in this area appears to be "yes", which introduces a new dimension of complexity to questions of food and diet.

:::

If we acknowledge the profound impact that sensory experience has on individual's dietary decisions there is a further requirement:

- Taste, flavour and texture must be desirable or at least tolerable

::: {.callout}

In a recent UCC study (Bot *et al*., 2020) we asked people to rate meal-replacement beverages (also referred to as 'oral nutritional supplements' in a medical context).
The results showed that across a broad product range the majority did not find them pleasant to consume.
These beverages contain large quantities of protein and fat.
While they can be sweetened and flavoured they are still thick liquids, which do not compare at a sensory level to a well-seasoned, freshly cooked meal.
In addition, there are common issues associated with their elevated protein content, such as the fact that protein tends to coat the tongue creating an unpleasant "sticky" sensation.

Even if someone finds a meal-replacer pleasant at a moment in time there is a known problem that occurs over time known as "taste fatigue".
While a meal-replacement beverage can be — and is usually — flavoured, we must consider that this beverage will serve as the primary source of nutrition for a person, potentially over an extended period (weeks, months, years?).
Patients receiving certain kinds of medical treatments may also experience taste and flavour differently during treatment, with their acceptance of a product potentially changing too:

> The success of supplementation depends, however, on the product acceptability and on patient compliance over the long term.
> 
> — from Ravasco, P (2005)

In a medical context, taste fatigue might mean that a patient puts their health/life at risk by reducing their food consumption.
In the context of a shop-bought meal-replacer, it might simply mean that a consumer stops buying the product.

:::

Lastly, we can consider some practical characteristics that are generally considered important from a lifestyle perspective. 

- Stable over shelf-life

::: {.callout}

It is preferable in many cases to buy a large volume of material that can be consumed over an extended period, rather than needing to continuously replenish your supplies.
For this to work, a food product needs to have an extended shelf-life.
Most replacers are processed by ultra-high temperature (UHT) or in-container sterilisation (ICS) treatments.
UHT and ICS expose the beverage to high temperatures (>100°C) in order to significantly reduce bacteria level.
After bottling and suitable storage this results in a product that is safe and that can be stored for multiple weeks or months.

There are trade-offs, however, that might be in tension with other goals.
For example, in the process of killing bacteria that might negatively impact shelf-life we might also be killing other bacteria that could have a positive influence on the gut microflora (high-temperature treatments hit many targets).
In addition, normal reactions that occur during the processing of foods (like the Maillard reaction) have been linked with negative nutritional effects, like the reduced bioavailability of amino acids such as lysine.

:::

Factors that are often emphasised by food scientists include:

- Affordable and convenient

::: {.callout}

If a meal-replacer can be manufactured such that it is cheap (relative to shopping for groceries or dining out) and convenient (by being possible to consume from a bottle) then these are often assumed to be positive features.
In certain cases, food being affordable and convenient is a necessity.
For example, for someone who has limited economic resources cheap food could be important; however, as a matter of policy and how we would like society to be, it would be preferable if these people were not restricted to bottled food!
When it comes to occupations or activities that involve hostile environments, conditions or climates, such as space travel, military conflicts and endurance exercise, it is essential that convenient sources of nutrition and hydration are available.

Now, the broader conclusion, that things should always be cheap and convenient is not necessarily justified.
Consider the case of remote and in-person learning.
Arguably, the provision of online lectures is more convenient for both students and professors; however, post-lockdown students and professors alike asked for a return to in-person learning.
Some students suggested that while lecture videos were convenient they did not have the self-discipline to watch them, and would prefer the inconvenience of needing to turn up in a classroom at a specific time.
Similarly, consider that we are often willing to pay money for quality.
It is understood that phones, clothes and food made from higher quality materials and more exacting manufacturing standards will often be more expensive.
No one would argue that a restaurant is more convenient than a takeaway, but people often want the restaurant *experience*. 
:::

We see in the above examples that there are many factors — including but not limited to nutritional ones — that we might expect to play a role in whether a meal-replacer is successful.
In addition, we see that achieving each of these things is not easy and involves some problems that have not yet been solved.
Please note that the remarks I have made above probably only represent a fraction of the considerations involved when developing such a product.
For example, we have completely neglected to consider the environment.

## Why Soylent is Interesting

I refer to Soylent as an interesting food product, yet it is largely equivalent — in principle — to products that pre-date Soylent (like Abbott Ensure)

It's still interesting for a variety of reasons:

- It was initially promoted as a complete meal-replacer for the general consumer (not just dieters or individuals with health conditions)
- The name is taken from a 1970s Sci-Fi movie where Soylent is a protein-rich food that turns out to be made from people
- Its marketing focused on convenience (meal preparation is too labor-intensive), productivity (save time for what you really want to do) and sustainability (only drink what you need)
- The concept attracted major criticism from journalists and nutritional scientists when news of its development spread
- The company repositioned itself recently to focus on "usage occasions" (people use the product in different ways) and expanded its range to include solid foods
- A significant proportion of its profits have historically been through e-commerce (e.g., online orders)
- Two-thirds of their consumers are millenials or younger
- Its creator blogged extensively about its early development (some of these blogs are very thoughtful and philosophical)
- As a diet food it shares many problems with other meal-replacers (namely: taste fatigue)
- A lot of its marketing and design has been influenced by the culture(s) of Silicon Valley, hacking and software (for example, the release of Soylent "versions")
- It spawned a "DIY Soylent" movement (name later changed to "Complete Foods") where people would design their own (personalised?) versions of the meal-replacer

In the end, the product consists mostly of a combination of dried ingredients that are mixed, heated and bottled.
:::

## Closing Thoughts

It is difficult to argue against the claim that meal-replacers are sometimes necessary in specific circumstances.
Even though they exist, the design of an *effective* meal-replacer for broad population groups ("young, busy people") is challenging scientifically and technologically.
In medical cases where meal-replacers might normally be recommended, dieticians increasingly suggest a "food first" approach — for example: to increase a patient's protein intake, a method to supplement meals (such as a protein gel) might be preferable to a meal-replacer.
A further interesting counterpoint is the trend of "personalised nutrition".
Nutritional guidelines inform the levels of ingredients that manufacturers put in nutritional products and how they are labelled.
These guidelines are designed for a statistical average rather than an individual person.
Increasingly, some scientists think that advances in technology that have made things like genetic screening and personal tracking cheaper, quicker and easier may allow diets to be personalised for individuals.
This area is at an early stage of development, but it is worth thinking about in the context of food technology (how could such individualised products be made?).
