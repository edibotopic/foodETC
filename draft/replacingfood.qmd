## Main Concepts 

- **Meal-replacer**: a food or beverage that is claimed to serve the function of replacing traditional meals in the diet 
- **Calories**: a measure of the energy density of food products 
- **Atwater factors**: conversion factors that allow scientists to convert between grams of a nutrient and their calorie content 
- **Label claim**: a claim on the label of a food product that relates to nutritional content and/or positive health impact

Can food be replaced?

If it can be replaced, what properties must be re-created in an effective replacement?

These questions are provoked by products like **Soylent**, a product claimed to be able to replace food with a drink consumed multiple times per day.

Another controversial case is **Nutraloaf**, a meal prepared for prisoners in some US prisons as a punishment for bad behaviour.

Consider these cases *critically*.
In each case, what arguments can be made in support of these materials and what arguments can be made against them?

Importantly, how can we evaluate claims about a material that is supposed to be "nutritionally complete" — is such a claim reasonable?

*Keep in mind: Soylent is a commercial product while Nutraloaf is not.*

## Thinking Critically

I am asking you to consider these cases *critically* but this does not mean that your are supposed to *level a criticism*.

*Crtical thinking* usually means reasoning carefully towards a specific goal.
This contrasts with other types of assessment like *memorisation*, where you simply recall ideas and reasons that have been given to you.

One of the major goals of a university education is learning to think for yourself.
In this example you might be expected to:

- State clearly the features of the objects under consideration
- Outline interesting arguments for/against their use
- Evaluate which arguments are stronger by evaluating how they are justified and what weighting we should give different factors

One of the reasons this is important is that in working life you will not be confronted with problems that have solutions ready-at-hand.
Your ability to solve such problems will be determined by your capacity to think through them when there aren't clear guidelines or someone to tell you the answer.

## Nutritional Completeness 

Consider the question of what it means for something to be "nutritionally complete".
In the interactive example below you can adjust the level of the major macronutrients in a model food.
Depending on the serving size, this will generate a specific calorie content.
play around with the values and see if you notice anything.

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
// Atwater factors
proFac = 4
lipidFac = 9
sugarFac = 4


md`---`
viewof protein = Inputs.range([0,12], {label: "protein (g)", step: 1, value: randomNumber(1,10)})
viewof lipids = Inputs.range([0,12], {label: "lipids (g)", step: 1, value: randomNumber(1,10)})
viewof sugar = Inputs.range([0,12], {label: "sugars (g)", step: 1, value: randomNumber(1,10)})

viewof servingSize = Inputs.range([100,500], {label: "Serving (g)", step: 50, value: 100})

totalCalories = servingSize * (protein/100*proFac + lipids/100*lipidFac + sugar/100*sugarFac)
md`---`
md`**Total calories** = ${totalCalories.toLocaleString("en")}.`

```

## Expand to read my observations

- Each nutrient contributes calories, and total calories are contributed by each nutrient
- It is possible to create different foods with the same calorie content but very different ratios of the nutrients
- Clearly serving size is a major factor: eating a lot of a low-calorie food might lead to a high calorie intake, eating a little of a high-calorie food might lead to a high calorie intake
- This model is a simplification in several respects, not least because it does not consider micronutrients

### How is total calories calculated?

Atwater factors represent the calories per gram of each nutrient.

| Nutrient | Factor    |
|--------- | :-------: |
| Protein  | 4         |
| Lipids   | 9         |
| Sugars   | 4         |

To determine the calories contributed by a nutrient in a food you simply multiply the grams of nutrient by the corresponding Atwater factor.

For example, milk contains $3.2\%$ protein.
This is the same as $3.2 g/100g$ protein.
If you drink 100 grams of milk the protein will contribute:

$$3.2 \times 4 = 12.8 \ calories-from-protein$$

However, calories are also contributed by *sugars* and *lipids*.

The corresponding calculations are:

$$3.5 \times 9 = 31.5 \ calories-from-lipids$$
$$4.8 \times 4 = 19.2 \ calories-from-sugars$$

To get the total you simply add the individual values together:

$$12.8 + 31.5 + 19.2 = 63.5$$

If you are interested in different serving sizes you need to divide by $100$ (to get the calories per $1 \ g$) and multiply by the desired serving size ($S$):

$$\frac{63.5}{100} \times S = ?$$

Many label claims like "high protein" require nutrients like protein to exceed a specific threshold value for either the proportion of calories they contribute or the proportion of recommended daily intake of that nutrient.

### What would a meal replacement need to achieve?

- Provision of sufficient calories
- Supply of nutrients, including micronutrients
- Taste, flavour and texture that is tolerable
- Stable to chemical and microbiological changes
- Affordable

**Question:** are the nutritional requirements the same for all adults?

## Preliminary answer 
No.

**Question:** can it be assume that nutritional content is sufficient to predict nutrient absorption in the body?

## Preliminary answer 
No.
