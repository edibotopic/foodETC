</span>

## Main Topics in Semester 1

3. Food **Semiotics** (`how food communicates with us`)
4. Food **Structure** (`why food is not just its parts`)

## Don't Worry 😟

The initial topics are selected based on the assumption that you
do not have a huge `science background`. We want to first get a sense
`how we understand and interact with food` in our daily lives, what our
intuitions are and how they might be wrong in some cases.
