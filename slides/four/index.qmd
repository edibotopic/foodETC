## Universal Versus Niche Technologies

Soylent was initially marketed as a complete meal-replacement.
Much of its notoriety arises from the universality of this claim.
For many, seeking efficiency by sacrificing food is undesirable.
However, such technologies can be useful in specific cases.

## Techno-optimism Versus Romanticism

In the Soylent future people have more time for other things, but many want still want time for food.
Critics argued that Soylent was strange but these were arguments from nature, or because 
the name was distasteful (not arguments of substance).

## Legitimate Issues with the Technology

It is arrogant to suggest that the full functionality of food can be replaced easily.
Diets are diverse, nutritional science isn't finished, taste fatigue is a problem.
