## Scientists Doing Philosophy? 

:::{.r-fit-text}
> More fundamentally, one finds the origin of `reductionism` in René Descartes (a French scholar of the sixteenth century) who viewed reality as the sum of components that could be divided into isolated entities, applying a `mechanistic` vision of the world. According to him, this decomposition and the resulting `simplification` would lead to the most appropriate explanation 
> [...] Contrary to reductionism, `holism` is defined broadly by the view that a phenomenon is an indivisible whole and that the sum of its parts is not sufficient to define it. In other words, the `whole is more than the sum of its parts`, i.e., 1 + 1 > 2

> — Anthony Fardet & Edmond Rock

## Scientific Cooking

:::{.r-fit-text}
> Take, for example, an eighteenth century book that advises us to cover the pan when beef is cooked with water to produce stock (Albert, 1838). If this recommendation is correct, `why`? And if it is not, `why` did someone write this sentence more than 150 years ago? To answer this question, we can use tools from physics, chemistry and biology — for example, the microscope, the thermometer and the gas chromatograph — to investigate the processes that take place during cooking. If we can answer the question, we can `correct` a mistake, use this knowledge to `improve` the cooking process or even `invent` new dishes or ways to prepare food.
