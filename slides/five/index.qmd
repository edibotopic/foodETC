## Universal Versus Niche Technologies

Soylent was initially marketed as a complete meal-replacement.
Much of its notoriety arises from the perceived *universality* of this claim.
However, such technologies can be undeniably useful in specific contexts.

## Techno-optimism and Romanticism

In a Soylent future people have more time to be productive, but not everyone places the same value on *productivity*.
Critics argued that Soylent was "strange" but often appealed to nature or vague concepts (wholeness).

## Legitimate Issues with the Technology

It is unwise to suggest that the the nutritional complexity of a diverse diet can be replicated in a beverage.
There are also known problems with successfully incorporating nutrients into processed food products.
These are major challenges with obvious trade-offs.
