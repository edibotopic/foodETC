Would a food scientist work on something like this?

What about these?

## Food Visions {background-image="./img/nature.jpg" transition="fade-in slide-out" background-color="black"}

:::{.r-fit-text}

- **Utopian**: in the future important food problems will be solved through science and technology

- **Dystopian**: in the future over-population and environmental devastation will lead to food scarcity

- **Romanticism**: in the past a low-tech society led to healthier lives and we should return to this life

## Worldviews

These are all *worldviews*, imaginings of what the past was or future will be.
There are no guarantees that a given *technology* will be used for bad or good.
There are also no guarantees that unknown *natural* things will help or harm us.

Ideally, whatever is adopted will be *freely-chosen* by *informed* (not confused or coerced) individuals.
The insects in Snowpiercer, the people in Soylent Green and the nutraloaf in prisons are not freely chosen.

## The Appeal to Nature

**P1.** All natural things are good for me

**P2.** This thing is natural

**C.** This thing is good for me 

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-warning}

## Why is this a Bad Argument?

The conclusion *follows* from the premisses but
it is not obvious that the premisses are **true**.

*Are all natural things good for you?*

*Is it easy to identify natural things?*

What things are natural❓ Are all of those things good ⁉️

We must be careful and precise if using vague concepts, 
but widely-used notions like 'natural' may still be useful.
Consider the example of 'nature-inspired design' in biomimetics.
