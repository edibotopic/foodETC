Would a food scientist work on something like this?

What about this?

## Food Visions

:::{.r-fit-text}

- **Utopian**: in the future important food problems will be solved through science and technology

- **Dystopian**: in the future our incorrect techno-scientific ideas and devestation of the environment will force us to eat terrible foods

- **Romanticism**: in the past everything was better, presumably because of a lack of technology

::: {.callout-note}
These are all *visions*, imaginings of what the past was or future will be.
There are no guarantees that a given *technology* will be used for bad or good.
There are also no guarantees that unknown natural things will help or harm us.

Ideally, whatever is adopted will be *freely-chosen* by *informed* (not confused or coerced) individuals.
The insects in Snowpiercer, the people in Soylent Green and the nutraloaf in prisons are not freely chosen.

## The Argument From Nature

**P1.** All natural things are good for me

**P2.** This thing is natural

**C.** This thing is good for me 

::: {.callout-warning}
Logically, this argument is **valid** but not **sound**.

The conclusion *follows* from the premisses but
it is not obvious that P1 and P2 are **true**.

We must be careful when using vague concepts, 
but widely-used notions like 'natural' may still be useful.
Consider the example of 'nature-inspired design'.

## Questions to Consider

1. Is it ever useful to use the term 'natural'?
2. Food preservation stops a 'natural' process ‚Äî is this bad?
3. Are other vague terms like 'purity' useful?
4. Do you think insects will ever be considered food?

## Foods of the Future

## Foods of the Future {auto-animate=true}

```{.text code-line-numbers="1-5"}
Programs intending to improve nutrition often fall short of expectations.

One exception, however, occurred during the rationing years 
of World War II when American citizens were encouraged to incorporate 
protein-rich organ meats into their protein deficient diets.

## Foods of the Future {auto-animate=true}

```{.text code-line-numbers="10-13"}
Programs intending to improve nutrition often fall short of expectations.

One exception, however, occurred during the rationing years 
of World War II when American citizens were encouraged to incorporate 
protein-rich organ meats into their protein deficient diets.

Unfortunately, most of the insights resulting from these 
efforts remained unpublished or in limited distribution.

For the first time, selected studies from this era are 
synthesized according to how they restructured social norms, 
changed perceptions of taste, and helped assimilate variety 
into their diets.

Programs intending to improve nutrition often fall short of expectations.

One exception, however, occurred during the rationing years 
of World War II when American citizens were encouraged to incorporate 
protein-rich organ meats into their protein deficient diets.

Unfortunately, most of the insights resulting from these 
efforts remained unpublished or in limited distribution.

For the first time, selected studies from this era are 
synthesized according to how they restructured social norms, 
changed perceptions of taste, and helped assimilate variety 
into their diets.

Behaviorally-driven implications from these ‚Äúlost lessons‚Äù are
discussed in the context of the empirical contributions they made in
defining what makes an unfavorable food acceptable.
