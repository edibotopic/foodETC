## Food Visions {background-image="./img/nature.jpg" transition="fade-in slide-out" background-color="black"}

:::{.r-fit-text}

- **Utopian**: in the future important food problems will be solved through science and technology

- **Dystopian**: in the future over-population and environmental devastation will lead to food scarcity

- **Romanticism**: in the past a low-tech society led to healthier lives and we should return to this life

## Worldviews

These are all *worldviews*, imaginings of what the past was or future will be.
There are no guarantees that a given *technology* will be used for bad or good.
There are also no guarantees that unknown *natural* things will help or harm us.

Ideally, whatever is adopted will be *freely-chosen* by *informed* (not confused or coerced) individuals.
The insects in Snowpiercer, the people in Soylent Green and the nutraloaf in prisons are not freely chosen.

## The Appeal to Nature

**P1.** All natural things are good for me

**P2.** This thing is natural

**C.** This thing is good for me 

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-warning}

## Why is this a Bad Argument?

**C**onclusion *follows* from **P**remisses BUT
it is not obvious that the premisses are **true**.

*Are all natural things good for you?*

*Is it easy to identify natural things?*

What things are natural❓ Are all of those things good ⁉️

We must be careful when using vague concepts like "natural". 
They may still be useful if we are precise about our meaning.
Consider the example of 'nature-inspired design' in [biomimetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics).
