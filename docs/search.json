    "text": "ChatGPT: Strengths and Weaknesses\nIn class the recently-published tool ChatGPT was demonstrated. This tool is clearly useful, insofar as it can (usually) generates coherent responses to whatever prompts you supply.\nWhile it is possible to simply ask “generate me an essay/speech” about a given topic, the most productive way of interacting with the tool is to — like the name suggests — engage in a back-and-forth chat. Generally, it will produce a response with apparent confidence, even if the text it generates contains vague statements and even factual errors. The problem for you — as a student at the early stage of your studies — is that it is difficult for you to distinguish between good and bad responses. Currently, simply trusting that what an AI tool generates is true and correct might lead you to make big errors, even if a significant proportion of the AI output is reasonable and correct. When finding information “the old fashioned way” this is less of a problem, because you can always try to find reliable sources; for example, highly-cited scientific articles, accurate historical records or objective fact-based journalistic reporting.\nIn my own experience, when asked about topics relating to food science ChatGPT often produces good high-level descriptions of well-established topics. However, it is not good at providing detail. Frequently it returns statements containing factual errors. While it can write citations and references it occasionally seems to make these up! Although the text generated by these tools may not be flagged by plagiarism software (at least not yet) it could well contain incorrect statements or fake references. It will also construct responses in obvious ignorance of how the module you are studying is designed; for example, if a lecturer spends an hour discussing a topic in class and you don’t pay attend or pay attention then both you and an AI are likely to miss a core point that the lecturer expects you to develop in an assessment."

    "text": "Using ChatGPT Effectively\nChatGPT might be particularly useful for generating rough summaries or overviews of a topic that get you through an initial stage of writer’s block. If you are asked to write an essay or create a presentation on a completely unfamiliar topic then ChatGPT might be able to supply you with some general ideas and some references to get you started. One helpful strategy is to identify ideas in ChatGPT’s output that seem underdeveloped or vague and ask specific follow-up questions to try to extract a more clear description — it might be the case that you never get a good response in such cases, which can be a good sign that this might be something you should explore yourself. This is not unlike the normal practice of doing academic writing, where we write something on a topic, identify which statements we have made that need to be developed further, conduct more research to improve their clarity and/or the evidence to support them, and so on (i.e., “writing is re-writing”)."

    "text": "Problems for you to Consider as a Student\nOne of the reasons that you are assigned essays, reviews and presentations is to develop your capacity to use writing/reading as a tool to improve your understanding of a topic. For example, when hired to work as a researcher you might be asked to write a literature review in your first few weeks. The purpose of this task is not to get marks or to publish the review, but rather to force you to come up-to-speed with research in the area you are going to be doing your research. An AI could conceivably write this for you and your manager might mistake it for your own work, but you will soon be revealed to know little about the area.\nAt this stage in your education, several of you might think that doing these projects is all about the outcome (“did I pass?”, “what grade did I get?”) but it is really about the process (“did I learn how to do something?”). It is conceivable that two students could do an essay, one student uses an AI and gets 70% and another does not and gets 60%, but the student who gets the lower mark actually learns more, is better prepared for future assignments, understands lectures better and ultimately becomes a stronger performer in the workplace. In truth, the best approach to take is probably to explore how to use AI as another tool in your arsenal (in addition to plain-old-fashioned writing and reading). It would be a mistake to ignore such technological developments, as they have the power to make some tasks more easy or efficient; however, as soon as you become simply a user of AI tools then you risk becoming replaceable."

A particle of 1 µm is 1000 times smaller than 1 mm.

    "text": "Structure → Function\nMany of the properties described above can be considered functional. More specifically, they can be considered “techno-functional”, in that they relate to some technical problem (e.g., thickening, gelling, preserving). Techno-functional properties are often distinguished from bio-functional ones, which are those that relate to the function a food or ingredient has in the human body.\nIncreasingly, food structure is often studied in relation to human digestion (biofunctionality). This is often referred to as the “food matrix effect”. For example, if we are interested in the digestion of amino acids or glucose molecules it is often valuable to consider the specific matrix (i.e., structure) those components are located within.\n\nCasein digests more slowly than whey proteins because it forms a gel in the stomach — this is why sports nutrition products are marketed as being either “slow release” or “fast release”\nCooked starch digests more quickly because the sugars are more accessible to digestive enzymes — this effect can also be leveraged to control the rate of digestion\n\nConsider the table below. Imagine you are asked (based on the data) which of the foods you expect to be most “water-like”. Intuitively, you might expect that the system that contains the most water would most closely resemble water (i.e., liquid). However, this neglects to consider how that water might be structured in the food matrix. For most it is surprising that milk has less water than a tomato, yet behaves more like a liquid, but this is not paradoxical if we have an appreciation for how water is structured differently in different foods.\n\n\n\nFood\nWater\nProtein\nLipids\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n\n\n🥛\n87.6\n3.2\n3.9\n4.8\n\n\n🍅\n93.1\n0.7\n0.3\n3.1\n\n\n🥑\n72.5\n1.9\n19.5\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Activity in Foods\n\n\n\nWater is often removed from foods in processes like evaporation and drying. It is known that such processes decrease microbial growth and therefore increase shelf-life.\nWater content, however, is not the best predictor of shelf-life. Instead, food scientists use the concept of water activity.\nWater activity can be considered as an estimate of the ratio of bound water to free water. The more bound water the lower the water activity. Water activity can be considered a structural property, in that it relates to how food molecules and water molecules interact.\nMore correctly, water activity is the ratio of the vapor pressure of a food divided by the vapor pressure of pure water. \\(H_2O\\) in pure water is not bound by other molecules and therefore tends to evaporate easily, generating vapor molecules that exert pressure. In food systems, the water is more tightly bound, reducing the number of vapor molecules that are generated and therefore creating less vapor pressure.\nFood scientists use instruments that measure water activity based on these principles, and reducing water activity is a frequent target of food processes."

    "text": "“All Foods are dispersed systems”\nDiagrams and animations can be very helpful when learning about food structures. However, they are also difficult to reproduce and remember.\nA simple shorthand — similar to algebra — has been developed to solve this problem. Note that it does not do many things we might expect from a mathematical equation we learn in school. For example, the formulas cannot be solved to yield a number.\nThe shorthand — called the Dispersed System Formalism — uses four letters that represent physical phases common in food systems: \\(G\\) for gas, \\(O\\) for oil, \\(S\\) for solid and \\(G\\) for gas. A symbol placed between two letters represents a structural relationship between those phases. The most common symbol is \\(/\\) for dispersed_in.\n\n\n\nPhase\nGas\nOil\nSolid\nWater\n\n\n\n\nGas\nG/G\nO/G\nS/G\nW/G\n\n\nOil\nG/O\nO/O\nS/O\nW/O\n\n\nSolid\nG/S\nO/S\nS/S\nW/S\n\n\nWater\nG/W\nO/W\nS/W\nW/W\n\n\n\nEach pair of letters in this table represents a possible structure. We can rewrite the table to represent the structures in plain english. Many food systems can be represented by the structures in this table. For example, yoghurt is a gel. Milk is an oil-in-water emulsion. Whey Protein Concentrate is a powder. Some of these may not be of interest to a food scientist; for example: a gas dispersed in a gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase\nGas\nOil\nSolid\nWater\n\n\n\n\nGas\nGas\nOil aerosol\nSolid aerosol (or powder)\nWater aerosol\n\n\nOil\nLiquid oil foam\nOil-in-oil emulsion\nSolid-in-oil suspension\nWater-in-oil emulsion\n\n\nSolid\nSolid foam\nOleogel\nSolid-in-solid suspension\nGel\n\n\nWater\nLiquid water foam\nOil-in-water emulsion\nSolid-in-water suspension\nWater\n\n\n\nBy “structure” here we mean the topological structure of the food. This means that it is primarily based on the notion of connection (how are the phases connected to each other?). For example, this is how we might think of a dispersion of oil in water:\n\nThere are two unique components\nThe oil is divided into multiple parts that do not connect\nAny point at the surface of a droplet of oil is connected with water\nNot every surface point of the water is connected with oil (example: the surface of the water)\nThe oil is therefore discrete (not self-connected) and the water continuous (self-connected)\n\nThis complex logic is encoded in the simple formula \\(O/W\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometry and Topology\n\n\n\nThese are both topics in pure mathematics but for our purposes we only need an intuitive understanding of the difference.\nYou remember from school that geometry involves the study of shapes like triangles and circles, which are assembled from points and lines. In geometry properties like length and direction are important, while in topology these are ignored.\nTopology is only concerned with connection and the classic joke about topology is that:\n\nTo a topologist there is no difference between a donut and a mug\n\nThe meaning of the joke is that both consist of a hole that is surrounded by a continuous self-connected region. In topology, as were only interested in connection, we ignore the different shape, size and function of both.\nSimilarly, when using DSF we are only concerned with the fact that yogurt is a gel, not whether the yogurt is in a bowl or a cup, or whether it is white or purple.\n\n\nNot all food products can be described using the notion of dispersion. For this reason, DSF includes a range of symbols that describe relations between phases:\n\nSuperposition (σ): one thing externally touching another (icing on a cake)\nInclusion (@): one thing inside of another (egg yolk in egg white)\nDisconnection (+): one thing disconnected to another (ice crystals and gas bubbles in icecream)\nBicontinuous (×): two things that are continuous with each other (strands of gelatine and water in a gelatine-based gel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: if you refer to the papers on this topic you will see some differences in how the symbols are used and described. This is because it is still under development.\n\n\n\nThese are illustrated using simple diagrams below for imaginary phases (x, y, z):\n\nFor example, consider the formula \\((x + y)/z\\). This would mean “x and y are both disconnected from each other, but both are dispersed in z”. Just like in equations, we can use brackets to group elements. For example, the following does not represent the same structure:\n\\[x + (y/z)\\]"

If viewing on a small screen it might be easier to open it in a new window. This app is a computer program and because DSF simply involves a finite set of symbols it is relatively easy to write a computer program that generates DSF formulae. As a more general point, it is worth considering the implications of using computers in this way to help us in the design of food products. In Computer-generated Imagery (CGI) used in movies and videogames it is common to use an approach called procedural generation. This means that instead of manually building mountains when we need to create a world, we simply define a set of rules that can be followed to build the structure (i.e., a mountain-building algorithm). DSF seems to create similar possibilities for food.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is another app (WriteHeight) that leverages digital technology to generate geometrical structures. The algorithm behind the app takes a black and white image then renders black regions as low and white regions as high. Gray colours create regions with heights somewhere in between these extremes. This technique is called “height-mapping”. The models can be downloaded and 3D-printed (the 3D printing part is not straightforward, but I am working on it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine designing a topological structure with DSF and then 3D-printing it into a geometric shape determined by a heightmap.

Manufacturing processes need to be designed to produce these products. A given process can achieve a variety of positive effects, including:\n\nMaking an inedible raw material into an edible food\nExtending the period during which a food remains edible\nImproving the sensory and/or nutritional properties of a food\nCreating unique structures or compositions that would not otherwise be possible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety\n\n\n\nThe concept of “safety” typically refers to the immediate risk posed by a material.

New ingredients, for example, have to undergo extensive testing to ensure that they do not have these harmful effects.\nMore recently, there has been greater attention paid to dietary issues such as obesity. The question has been raised: do we pay sufficient attention to how the consumption of specific kinds of processed foods impacts the bodyweight of individuals across their life?\nThis is an interesting and important question that is very difficult to answer, due to the complex array of factors and long timespans involved."

In thermal processing, food is heated or cooled, usually with the intention of improving safety and/or shelf-life. Many bacteria that are dangerous (pathogenic) can have their levels reduced by heating. Foods that are sterilised, which effectively eliminates most bacteria, are often exposed to temperatures in excess of 100°C for several minutes, rendering them safe to consume.\nHowever, excessive heating can have other effects. Some nutrients, especially water-soluble vitamins, are sensitive to heat. Chemical reactions between food molecules can occur, changing the colour, taste and texture. The scientific approach to food processing involves accounting for these trade-offs. For example, a scientist may determine what the minimum time-temperature combination is to reduce bacteria to a target level while minimising negative impacts on vitamins. If it is discovered that there is always a 25% loss in vitamin C, then the starting material may be fortified with additional vitamin C to account for this inevitable loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis strategy of adding an excess of a nutrient to account for process-induced losses is referred to as an “overage”."

Irradiation is a non-thermal method of improving the safety and shelf-life of foods. It has been studied for decades and has been shown to be an effective means of killing bacteria. Despite this, irradiation technology has not received wide acceptance. Misplaced concerns that the resultant foods are radioactive or depleted of nutrients have resulted in significant fear concerning the technology. In fact, when carefully controlled non-thermal treatments of this kind can lead to reduced nutrient losses. It is also certainly not the case that irradiated foods are radioactive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerbs and Spices\n\n\n\nOne of the most common applications of irradiation today is herbs and spices. In some countries this is the only permitted use for food irradiation.\nHerbs and spices are valued for their flavour and aroma, which are characterised by their volatility.\nThese volatile components can be lost at elevated temperatures. Irradiation is therefore a “cold” alternative to heat processes for decontamination of herbs and spices that maintains their sensory profile.\n\n\nIn any case, at one point irradiated food was a new technology. It was subject to considerable scientific research, which determined that it was an effective method of preserving food. However, to some extent it is a failure, insofar as its level of utilisation is low relative to its potential.\nThe reason for this is that any technology must not only succeed under the microscope, it must also succeed in the marketplace. Society needs to be convinced that the technology is not only effective, but also safe and necessary."

Therefore, a lot of money and science goes into the development of products that do not convince people of their value.\nMany developments in the food industry are incremental. For example, consumers may want a breakfast cereal to come in a new flavour. Decreased sales of a gelatin-containing product may prompt a company to replace gelatin with a more animal-friendly alternative. These changes are often “pulled” from the consumer.\nA radical new technology may also only result in an incremental change. This is the case with a technology like irradiation, which is a radically different way of processing food that receives limited application in products like spices. These new technologies must be “pushed” on consumers, who may reject them if they are not convinced of their value.\nIt is not sufficient for a technology to be scientifically-approved to have a large impact in the marketplace. The technology must be deliberately designed for people. People must be convinced of the value it adds to their lives.\n\n3D Food Printing\nA technology we have encountered before — 3D Food Printing — is an interesting case study. The technology is radical and new, making things possible that were impossible before. 3D printing is not well understood by the public, with the exception of some hobbyists. 3D food printing is even less well understood, with few well-known applications or success stories. Dozens of scientific papers are published every year on 3D food printing.\nThe question is: will 3D food printing succeed? At this point any answer is mere speculation. However, here is the current state-of-play:\n\nScientists are interested in food printing, which allows new structures and textures to be created\nSome particular applications have been suggested, such as the use of food printing to reduce “taste fatigue” in individuals who must consume restricted diets or in the recreation of meat structure in printed plant-based foods\nA small number of chefs and startups have begun experimenting with food printing as a means to create new food experiences\nThere is a recognition among scientists of some difficulties with food printing, especially around the consistency with which a wide variety of different food materials can be printed accurately\nA non-negligible number of consumers are concerned that 3D-printed food might be unsafe (for unspecified reasons)\n\nWhen it comes to a new technology like 3D printing, it is not only a question of doing more science but also of imagining what could be designed for people that would help, interest or excite them.

    "text": "Preface to the Module\nFood is both astonishingly complex and boringly familiar. That there is a science of food, and that students study this at a university, comes as a great surprise to some people. Yet these same people often have many questions about their own food choices and how their food is manufactured that are difficult to answer using “common sense”. The effects of diet on health, lifestyle and the environment are some of the most pressing questions facing society today, and the knowledge of food scientists will play a key role in answering them.\nSome of these questions are age-old – how can we feed a growing population? – others more contemporary – do palatable alternatives to animal-based products exist that are less harmful to the environment? — and some quite controversial – should food choice be determined by personalised data to prevent diet-related disease? A university education will not give you the answers to all of these questions, but it will prepare you to begin finding the answers (or better questions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Slice\n\n\n\nLike most science degrees, each year of the BSc Food Science builds on the foundation of the previous year. Students might be interested in learning about beer brewing or ice-cream manufacture from day one. However, to appreciate these topics fully one has to master more foundational material, such as:\n\nChemistry (year 1)\nFood engineering (year 2)\nSensory science (year 3)\n\nThen in year 4 a student is considered ready to approach the full complexity of food product to the point that they can develop their own in a systematic fashion:\n\nProduct development (year 4)\n\nThe difficulty with this approach for students is that for a long while they can feel out-of-touch with what they came to university to study (in this case food). This module is designed as a vertical slice through the whole degree. Samples of each year, ranging from the fundamentals in year 1 to advanced topics in year 4, are found throughout. The challenge with this approach is that the students have not studied the pre-requisites for the more advanced material. For this reason, a somewhat philosophical approach is adopted, focusing on general concepts, case studies and critical thinking.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy the module."

    "section": "General Features of Scientific Knowledge",
    "text": "General Features of Scientific Knowledge\nPhilosophers continue to argue over what makes science special as a form of human knowledge. There is general agreement that the following features can be recognised in the scientific process.\n\nFalsifiable: a scientific claim can — in principle — be tested and determined to be false\nMechanistic: scientific facts are justified by reference to testable causal mechanisms\nExplanatory: science does not merely observe effects, it explains what causes those effects\nGeneralisable: scientific ideas can be applied successfully in a range of problems\nObjective: scientific studies are designed to eliminate or minimise the influence of personal bias\nInter-subjective: a scientific work is evaluated (subjectively) by a community of peers who form an (inter-subjective) consensus on its merits\n\nA scientific claim might be wrong but even then it is typically wrong for the right reasons. This means that the scientists believed in their claim and had a justification, but it turned out to be false. Subsequently, people can determine how they were wrong in their justification and develop better justifications that get closer to the truth. Contrast this with a mere opinion, where someone has no justification for their belief but happens to guess right. This person might feel good about being right but they were lucky and cannot explain how they arrived at that conclusion. Furthermore, repeat the scenario 100 times — how often are they likely to be right using this approach? Providing justifications for our beliefs is important, especially when discussing important and potentially dangerous topics like food and diet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Scientific Paper\n\n\n\nI have a blog and I have a PhD; however, what I publish on my blog is not as reliable a source of information compared to a scientific paper. Universities and newspapers sometimes summarise the findings of a scientific paper, but these summaries are not as reliable as the original scientific paper.\nOn my blog, I choose when to publish the material and nobody checks or edits what I write. Universities and newspapers want to emphasise why the paper is important; in the first case, this might be to increase the prestige of the university, and in the second case it might be to appeal to readers who have a limited understanding of science.\nAn online “influencer” who sells you a new diet is not a reliable source of information either (does their advertising revenue depend on people buying products related to that diet? are they attractive because of the diet or were they attractive before the diet also? do we know for sure that they even follow the diet? is their medical information about their health since pursuing the diet?).\nWhen you are looking for information you need to think critically about the sources. Not every scientific paper is perfect, but the process by which they are published is incredibly demanding:\n\nDevelopment of testable question\nAcquiring funding from someone who thinks the question is worthwile\nPerforming several months of rigorous experiments to answer the question\nWriting a detailed account of the study in such detail that it can be repeated by others\nConvincing at least two anonymous scientists that your work is trustworthy, reliable and interesting\nImproving the paper by responding to criticisms from the editor and the anonymous reviewers\nPublishing the paper and hoping it has impact, meaning that other scientists reference it and use its ideas\n\nIn comparison, here’s the steps to publishing a blog (even by a PhD scientist!):\n\nWrite the blog\nClick publish\n\nKnow the difference.\n\n\nNote that science ≠ technology. Scientific knowledge may be applied in the design of technology. Correct scientific knowledge can be applied to create a dangerous technology (e.g., the nuclear bomb). This does not mean that the original scientific knowledge was flawed or dangerous (in and of itself). Technology may be motivated by different reasons and principles than a purely scientific pursuit (e.g., profit). We will discuss these topics in greater detail in semester 2."

    "text": "Models, Analysis and Synthesis\nIt is important to distinguish between ontological claims and epistemological claims.\nThe claim “humans are machines” may be interpreted as ontological, in that it suggests that people literally are machines in reality. However, saying that “humans can be thought of as machines” is epistemological, and only means that the machine is a useful model for explaining how humans work. Consider the video below, which is based on a famous depiction (1926) of the human body by a German scientific illustrator named Fritz Kahn. In it, the body is depicted as a factory with miniature people manning the operations. Clearly, it would be ridiculous to believe (ontologically) that this was what bodies were actually like. Yet this familiar and simplistic model can serve a useful explanatory role. Kahn lived at a time of industrialisation, so the factory was a feature of the popular consciousness. He used the factory as an analogy to explain the workings of the body to a popular audience.\n\n\nThe human-as-factory model is still alive and well in some food science papers. Such a model can be valuable as it simplifies complex systems and improves our ability to study them. For example, it is difficult (ethically and practically) to do scientific studies with real people; they may become sick and their lifestyles might influence the results. For this reason it is difficult to study human digestion. By modelling human digestion as a factory process, we can design miniature factories in laboratories where digestion can be studied in a controlled manner, without potentially harming people. However, we must be careful not to fall into the trap of assuming that people are machines (e.g., that they “only need fuel” and that they should “maximise their efficiency”).\nScientists are frequently criticised as being “reductionists” by people who claim to be “holists”. However, most good scientists need to consider the whole as well as the parts. Indeed, they need to consider how the parts interact in the formation of the whole. This is what scientists usually mean by the “structure” of the systems they study. Consider the video above again — the human body is not depicted as a collection of parts operating independently; instead, the various sub-systems (gastrointestinal, respiratory, circulatory, etc.) work together in the (whole) system of the human body. This moving between parts and wholes in the study of systems is characteristic of good science."

    "section": "The Sciences of Food",
    "text": "The Sciences of Food\nFood is studied by a variety of disciplines inside, outside and adjacent to food science. There are food scientists, but also food geographers and food historians. Even within the sciences there are a variety of disciplines, including:\n\nFood science\nNutritional science\nMolecular gastronomy\nGastrophysics\n\nIt is difficult to make a total separation between these disciplines. Food scientists study nutritional science during their degrees. Some go on to work with products that have primarily a nutritional function (e.g., infant formula). Nutritional scientists study food science during their degrees. Some go on to work in technical roles that are commonly occupied by food scientists (e.g., quality control). The difference is really a matter of emphasis: food scientists devote more of their time on the systematic study of food processing, food structure and food chemistry, and have a broad conception of “food function” that encompasses nutrition but also other factors (e.g., convenience, taste, texture). Nutritional scientists place a greater emphasis on the systematic study of the body and the manner in which nutrients are processed physiologically, as well as the population-wide trends in the consumption of specific nutrients and how this might be linked with health conditions. These two types of scientist have significant overlaps in their knowledge but must specialise in some different topics to support their research. Food scientists, for example, must understand the link between processing and nutritional quality of food, so they study more physics and engineering. Nutritional scientists, for example, have to study large datasets about populations, so they study more statistics, and a selection of them go on to further study to work as dieticians, so they also learn about clinical topics. Often they must work together (in universities or in companies) in order to fill in the gaps in their knowledge and a work effectively as a team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Scientists and Nutritional Scientists at UCC\n\n\n\nScientists at UCC have in recent years been working on a sports nutrition product (full disclosure: I am involved in the project). The product is designed to enhance muscle recovery in high-performance athletes.\nThis project requires close collaboration between food scientists and nutritional scientists. At the outset, nutritional scientists know what they want:\n\nto improve muscle recovery\n\nbut not how to achieve it, so food scientists develop the product concept further and the establish how it will be made. During this stage the food scientists must design the product with the nutritional goal in mind while also ensuring it does not cause other issues (sensory, safety).\nOnce the product is manufactured the nutritional scientists determine whether the product works by performing a Clinical Trial. Then it can be concluded whether it can be said with statistical confidence that the product enhances muscle recovery.\nFinally, the food scientist and nutritional scientists will publish their results as a scientific paper.\n\n\nOccasionally, scientists consider an existing discipline to have ignored or downplayed an important topic, which they suggest warrants the creation of a new discipline. This was the case with molecular gastronomy, created by the scientists Nicholas Kurti and Herve This, who felt that food science has paid insufficient attention to cooking. Molecular gastronomy is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of food science and shares many of its methods and principles. The more recently developed gastrophysics was proposed by the psychologist Charles Spence, and has highlighted how food experiences are influenced by psychological factors and the context of the experience. Gastrophysics is closely related to sensory science, a long-standing sub-discipline of food science but which has less emphasis on psychological concepts. Many of these disciplines are “sub-disciplines” insofar as they study a sub-set of problems within food science. In set-theoretic language, food science is then the “power set” (the set of all those sub-sets).\nFood scientists absorb these new directions and it comes to influence their work. For example, when McClements tries to define what food science is for a popular audience he frequently appeals to research in molecular gastronomy. As students, even though you do not have a dedicated university module in molecular gastronomy, there is nothing stopping you from reading and learning about molecular gastronomy. Doing this might make you a better food scientist.\nOne of the goals of molecular gastronomy is to make cooking a more scientific process. To achieve this one of its methods of investigation was to study recipes and attempt to explain scientifically steps in the recipe that were imprecise or vague. Herve This, one of its co-founders, even proposed a kind of language that can be used as a tool to automate the generation of recipes. We will discuss this language in the next lecture on food structure."

The harnessing of fire in cooking has even been claimed to be a critical moment in the growth of the human brain (Wrangham, 2009). Early developments in preservation, such as salting and smoking, alleviated the survival pressure to continuously find new food. As societies shift from a context of food scarcity to one of food abundance, there can be increased opportunities to focus on other activities, including leisure, creativity and study. This story is a tale of progress but some have argued that problems such as obesity are evidence that we are going backwards. Despite the fact that we all eat, there is not universal agreement on what food is, what is good food and what might become food.\nProfessional food scientists work on a variety of product types. Something like whiskey is not what most people would characterise as “food” due to its limited nutritional value, yet food scientists do study whiskey. Whiskies have other qualities that are valued by people who consume them (e.g., aroma richness, colour intensity, alcohol content). They must be processed in a very controlled way using operations like distillation to ensure they are safe and consistent. Whiskey and a protein supplement are both studied by food scientists but they have completely different functions. While the supplement has a greater nutritional value it is itself difficult to characterise as “food” given that it is by definition supplementary to a diet consisting largely of food. If we put aside whether these materials are food and just consider that food scientists are interested in “things that are consumed” we run into the problem of distinguishing foods from drugs. Indeed, while the food and pharmaceutical industries are distinct there is increasing overlap in some of their products, especially considering the emphasis now placed on biological functions of food products that are beyond basis nutrition.\nNot only is food difficult to define, but what we consider food tends to change. With the introduction of new technologies — like 3D printing — and new ingredients — like insect protein — our concept of food is continuously challenged. While scientists and engineers tend to be utopian in their attitude and imagine that all technological development will result in societal progress. Others are dystopian in their outlook, imagining a future in which technology has damaged society and the planet. Dystopianism often coexists with a romantic vision of the past, a better time when we were closer to nature. Before adopting such a philosophy we should try to consider what it means for something to be food.\nThese issues are complex and we want to starting thinking about them in as general terms as possible."

    "section": "Parts and Wholes",
    "text": "Parts and Wholes\nAny system can be described in terms of parts and wholes:\n\nA classroom is a whole consisting of a teacher and students\nA kitchen mixer is a whole consisting of a motor, shaft and paddle\nA salad is a whole consisting of (typically) cold ingredients and dressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I brought a kitchen mixer into the classroom to do a demonstration then the mixer would be a sub-system in the classroom. Two friends who begin to ignore the lecture and start their own conversation also form a sub-system, and so on. Much of reality can be analysed into sub-systems and many systems — in this way — can be considered super-systems (comprised of multiple sub-systems).\n\n\n\nWhen describing the structure of a system we are interested in the relations between the parts. A relation is just some way that two or more parts form a connection (physically or conceptually). For example, a teacher and a student can be described according to the following relation (in block capitals):\n\nteacher TEACHES student\n\nA motor and shaft in a mixer:\n\nmotor DRIVES shaft\n\nA salad as:\n\ndressing COATS ingredients\n\nAn egg is:\n\nliquid INSIDE shell\n\nIt is always possible to develop a new model for our system. Consider the classroom example, which assumes one-way communication between teacher and student. Below we have a more complex model, describing a case in which student A attends class and is taught by the teacher. The communication is bidirectional, because the student asks and answers questions. Student B did not attend class, so relies on what the other student tells them about the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\nteacher\n\nteacher\n\n\n\nstudent A\n\nstudent A\n\n\n\nteacher-&gt;student A\n\n\n\n\n\nstudent A-&gt;teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nstudent B\n\nstudent B\n\n\n\nstudent A-&gt;student B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModels\n\n\n\nModels are representations of reality used to frame a set of problems so that they can be studied effectively.\nA model may be revised as new evidence emerges.\n\n\nIt is common for thinkers to consider two ways of approaching the study of such systems:\n\nHolism: things should be understood by studying the thing as a whole\nReductionism (or ‘individualism’): things should be understood by studying their individual parts\n\nReductionism is commonly associated with scientific thinking, which — we will see — is somewhat of a simplification. The reason for this is that good scientific explanations do not only consider parts, but also how parts relate with each other and the whole in question (through interactions, mechanisms and so on). In this way science is systematic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemism\n\n\n\nAn approach to studying the world that considers the mechanisms by which parts interact as wholes within a given environment.\nThe object of study is always a system, which can be defined in terms of composition (the parts) and structure (the whole).\nNote that the environment (or context) is critical: ingredients behave differently in different media; foods are tolerated more or less well by different individuals; diets can be more or less successful for different lifestyles.\n\n\nAdvocates of holism commonly consider that important properties of wholes emerge in a manner that is not explainable by reference to their parts. This often leads to assumptions that certain properties are — in effect — mysterious and unexplainable. As a result, holism is often an unscientific position, as it asserts that there are real, important things that cannot be investigated or understood.\nA food scientist is interested in the qualities that wholes have (is this food product enjoyable?) as well as the mechanisms by which parts determine these qualities (what molecules are associated with this enjoyment?). Food scientists therefore operate at and between two levels:\n\nMacro: the qualities that can be experienced and observed\nMicro: the parts and interactions that culminate in qualities\n\nMoving from macro to micro is analysis (studying the molecular cause of observed food decay). Moving from macro to micro is synthesis (building a model of food decay based on observation and analysis). In science, we constantly move between analysis and synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\nmicro\n\nmicro\n\n\n\nmacro\n\nmacro\n\n\n\nmicro-&gt;macro\n\n\n\n\n\nmacro-&gt;micro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis concept will be covered in more detail in the Epistemology lectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergence\n\n\n\nEmergence is an ontological concept that suggests that a set of parts when combined can produce a whole with properties not possessed by any of the parts.\nFor example, a \\(H_2O\\) molecule does not have the property of viscosity (resistance to flowing) but when millions of these molecules are combined into a liquid that liquid is observed to have viscosity.\nSimilarly, one person does not have the property of social cohesion, but citizens in a country do have social cohesion when operating as a group of people.\nEmergence is sometimes argued to make reductionism (and science) insufficient to explain reality; however, scientists do not deny emergence and do not attempt to explain emergent properties solely by reference to parts.\nScientists and holists agree that certain qualities seem to “emerge”. The difference is that in science it is assumed that there is an explanation (it may just not have been discovered yet) while in holism it is often assumed that no such explanation can be found.\n\n\n\nBoundaries and Levels\nTo make progress we often need to draw a boundary around the (sub)system that interests us. When working on anything we usually operate within some constraints (e.g., time, money). We may draw a boundary around the macronutrients of food, proteins (P), sugars (S) and lipids (L). In symbols this could be written:\n\\[Food = \\{P,S,L\\}\\]\nThis, however, is quite limited, as food also contains micronutrients, like vitamins (V) and minerals (M):\n\\[Food = \\{[P,C,L],[V,M]\\}\\]\nFood also contains taste (T), flavour (F) and aroma (A) molecules:\n\\[Food = \\{[P,C,L],[V,M],[T,F,A]\\}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meaning of these Symbols\n\n\n\nThese type of equations might be familiar to you from set theory, which everyone studies in school.\nFood can be defined as a set of elements (elements meaning elements of a set rather than chemical element).\nThinking strictly in nutritional terms:\n\\[Food = \\{[P,C,L],[V,M]\\}\\]\nThis means there are two subsets (inside the square brackets) — micronutrients (\\(Mi\\)) for the first subset and macronutrients (\\(Ma\\)) for the second. We can then define the nutritional composition of food (\\(F_n\\)) as the union of these subsets:\n\\[F_n = Mi \\cup Ma\\]\nNow assume that we have similar definitions for the structural elements of food (\\(Fs\\)), the psychological elements of food (\\(Fp\\)), the economic elements of food (\\(Fe\\)) and so on (…), we can then define food (\\(F\\)) as:\n\\[F = \\{Fn,Fs,Fp,Fe,...\\}\\]\nYou do not have to learn these equations and will not be examined on your ability to understand them. They allow complex ideas to be expressed in a single line and are useful tools to order our thinking. When thinking through these concepts you might benefit from tis approach.\n\n\nWhen trying to solve a food science problem we can restrict ourselves to chemistry but — as discussed in class — we can include different aspects of food in our analysis when thinking in terms of physics and biology. For example, in class I mentioned how we can consider bread in terms of its chemical composition (what is its gluten content?), its physical properties (how elastic is it?) but also the biological mechanisms that give it structure (which yeast content will generate the optimal fermentation?).\nFor a moment, let’s think bigger, and imagine a food product in a supermarket:\n\nThe food has a chemical composition\nThe food has an appearance, perceived by the shopper\nThe food has a format and package, influencing how it can be used\nThe food has a price, which the shopper must be willing to pay\nThe food has competitors that may be more or less preferred\nThe food might have a health claim and this could be true or false\nThe food has been manufactured and transported, giving it an environmental footprint\n\nConsider a case where a consumer sees a product in a shop and considers buying it. The product has been manufactured in an environmentally-friendly way and is rich in a variety of nutrients. However, they recently spoke to their friend who heard a news story about that product causing a case of food poisoning.

As our time and resources are limited we sometimes need to draw a boundary around a smaller set of things in order to — basically — get work done. However, when we do this we must not forget that a boundary has been drawn (the map is not the territory).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Analysis: The Map is Not the Territory\n\n\n\nIf food scientists are confronted with a problem that involves particles that sink in a beverage to form a sediment, they may restrict their analysis to:\n\nWhole: suspension of solid particles in liquid\nParts: solid particles, surrounding liquid\n\nThey can then develop a physical solution to the problem: making the particles smaller so that they sink more slowly.\nIn this case there is no advantage to studying the system at a finer scale (molecules) or a larger scale (supermarket). However, the nature of this analysis does not mean that the scientist denies the existence of molecules or supermarkets!\n\n\nThere is a sense in which food is a collection of chemicals, a sense in which it is a physical system, a sense in which it is an economic commodity, and a sense in which it is a source of nutrients for human growth, and a sense in which it is an object of desire. All of these ways of categorising food can be useful. Because we are in a university classroom we have the luxury of thinking big so that we can develop a complex understanding of food. The mathematician Eugenia Cheng in a talk at Google gives an excellent example of thinking in systematic terms about the phenomenon of gaining weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReductionism Involves Small Boundaries, Not Small Components\n\n\n\nReductionism is often associated with thinking in terms of physically small things (atoms, molecules, gears). For example, when it comes to environmental issues it might be suggested that it is reductionist to talk about molecules and we should instead focus on the environment. Molecules are small, the environment is big and the environment contains molecules. The assumption is then that if we focus on studying the bigger thing then we will understand the system fully.\nHowever, a strict focus on molecules and a strict focus on the environment both “reduce” our thinking to a particular level of analysis. By drawing a boundary around observable things in the environment we restrict ourselves to a surface-level understanding of the problem. By drawing a boundary around microscopic things we lose sight of how they make important contributions to the environment.\nWaste from a factory can pollute a river which can be observed to decrease the population of fish. However, it is often the high level of phosphorus in these wastes that causes eutrophication, promoting the growth of algae and — in turn — depleting oxygen that the fish need to survive.\nUnderstanding the underlying (micro-level) events helps us identify the cause of the (macro-level) problem and develop strategies to prevent its occurrence (not every waste is phosphorus-rich). There is a benefit to integrating the two levels of analysis."

    "section": "Seeking a definition",
    "text": "Seeking a definition\nWhen asked to define an object as seemingly everyday as food many are quick to consult a dictionary. Here, we will generally find something like:\n\na material containing nutrients that when consumed provides an organism with the means to grow\n\nIs this a good definition? Most intuitively answer ‘yes’. However, when asked to describe favourite foods people will mention things like:\n\nSensory attributes (taste, aroma, flavour, texture, sound)\nContextual factors (sharing food, celebrating with food, food as a reward)\nIngredient pairings (chocolate with caramel, cheese with crackers, beer with chips)\nFunctional properties (muscle building, weight loss, skin health, life extension)\n\nEarlier I indicated that scientists focus on parts while non-scientists focus on wholes — this is a simplification that we will need to revisit. In fact, scientists are interested in wholes (or the qualities that wholes are observed to have) but in the following specific ways:\n\nWhat causes certain qualities?\nWhich qualities do people prefer?\nHow can qualities be measured?\n\nNote: while qualities like redness and sweetness are subjective this does not mean that scientists are not interested in them. In fact, as the consumption of food is driven to a great extent by subjective factors, food scientists are greatly interested in these properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: don’t rely on a dictionary\n\n\n\nDictionaries provide definitions for the common usage of terms in an everyday context.\nThe meaning of a word can change over time. At a given time a word might have an imprecise meaning, or even multiple possible meanings. Some individuals may have a more detailed understanding of a term by — for example — being experts on a topic.\nYou are in university to develop a deeper knowledge of food than most people. People argue about food in spite of the existence of dictionary definitions. These issues are not settled and we need to think about them carefully.\n\n\nConsider the claim:\n\nfood is a collection of nutrients\n\nIn most cases, food necessarily contains a significant quantity of nutrients. However, it is not the case that food only contains nutrients. The primary constituent of most foods is water, nearly all foods contain bacteria and there is a broad class of other non-nutritional factors (e.g., fibres) that can be studied. Any food scientist that neglects the role of water, bacteria and fibre in food and diet is not doing their job well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater\n\n\n\nFood scientists spend a lot of time studying and manipulating water in food systems. The amount of water in a food is critical in determining the time it takes to rot. The presence of water in specific forms — like crystals — is also important for the texture of products like ice-cream. Nutritionally, a significant proportion of our water intake is in the form of food.\n\n\nThink about ice-cream for a moment. Why do people buy ice-cream? Usually because they enjoy certain qualities (coldness, melting, sweetness, texture). When is ice-cream frequently served? After a meal (not as the meal).\nNot all food is like ice-cream, in which nutrition is often a secondary consideration. Some foods — like infant formula — can be considered to serve primarily a nutritional function. However, most foods are selected for a wide variety of reasons (nutrition, sensory, culture, etc.). Narrowing our definition of food to a single class of molecules (nutrients) or properties (taste) leads to a limited understanding of food and reduces our capacity to design foods for different individuals and contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Needs\n\n\n\nIn primary school most of us encountered the distinction between needs and wants. Food is often considered a need, like water, rather than a want like a VR headset. As food is needed for survival, this can lead to the view that as long as a food contributes to survival it is good.\nNow consider some other “base needs” like clothes and shelter. Certainly, both jackets and houses protect us from our environments. However, think about the actual place where you live or the outfit that you are wearing. Do you think what makes these things “good” is solely determined by their capacity to protect you from the environment? When you think of how your apartment could be better or what shoes you might prefer are you thinking:\n\nHow will this maximise my capacity to survive in my environment?\n\nThe answer is surely ‘no’ because — living in a safe, rich country — your survival is effectively ensured. Given that most (though not all) people in a country like Ireland have an adequate supply of nutrients the question is rarely ‘how will I have enough food to survive?’ but rather ‘what foods do I most desire?’."

    "section": "Ontology",
    "text": "Ontology\nWe are seeking general ideas about food rather than particular ones. If we started listing all of the particularities of different foods, such as redness, freshness, spiciness then we would have a very long list. We would throw our hands up at some point and say ‘it’s complicated’. When doing ontology we aim for more general ideas. Redness and spiciness are sensory properties. Foods possess those properties and they can be sensed. Freshness is also a property, but its meaning is less clear (can you think of how it would be sensed?). We could categorise the different kinds of properties that foods have and any properties (like freshness) that seem ill-defined. This would be doing ontology, but the clarity it would provide can help us do science (how will we measure freshness?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects and Relations\n\n\n\nAs an abstract study, ontology can be applied to many different cases:\n\nA family is a set of people (objects) with an ancestry and/or affinity (relations)\nA meal consists of a combination of ingredients (objects) that are edible to people (relation)\nA sentence consists of characters (objects) that can be combined according to syntax rules (relation)\nA mathematical formula consists of symbols like numbers (objects) and operators like addition (relations)\nA diet consists of quantities of specific foods (objects) that satisfy some dietary goals (relations)\n\nThe definitions above have been stipulated by me and you might disagree. For example, you might think that a better account of a meal would include:\n\nAdditional objects (cutlery, plates, courses, drinks, dinner guests, the price)\nAdditional relations (order of courses, food-drink pairings, comfort with setting, familiarity between people)\n\nWhen doing ontology it is possible (in theory) to reach for a full account of a system. Often in science we must draw a boundary somewhere to make the problem tractable.\n\n\nOntology is similar to mathematics in that it involves the abstract study of objects. When doing ontology, however, we usually try to determine what we can say about reality. For most mathematicians, talking about sets or numbers does not mean that these objects exist physically. Mathematics is neutral with respect to reality and is only concerned with mathematical objects.\nAt a very basic level ontology concerns two kinds of thing:\n\nObjects\nRelations\n\nFrom these simple types of things we can reason about a lot, including structures and systems. The question what is an emulsion? is answered by considering the objects (oil and water) and the relations (the oil is dispersed in the water). An emulsion is a structure that is defined as a dispersion of oil and water. This structure has important properties — it can dissolve both water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxonomies and Food Pyramids\n\n\n\nA taxonomy that you encounter in biology is a kind of ontological model. Typically, a taxonomy classifies objects into a hierarchy. This means between any two objects there is an order (\\(x\\) is either higher or lower than \\(y\\)). In a biological taxonomy the highest level (or ‘rank’) is the most general while the lowest is the least general. Plants and animals share general attributes of Life, but a red fox and a white rose have different attributes as different Species.\nThe traditional food pyramid is an ontology of this kind — but objects at the lowest level (fruits, veg) are considered more foundational to the diet. A less common type of model is a meronomy, which classifies objects on the basis of parthood. MyPlate, a replacement for the food pyramid, consists of a meal (the whole) and its parts (fruits, grains, veg, protein, dairy). This model attempts to establish what the necessary components should be for every meal. Revisions to the food pyramid have taken place multiple times over the decades. There continues to be debate over this issue because people disagree over what factors are important when categorising food. For example, increasingly there are calls to include environmental impact in such classifications.\n\n\nA structure is simply a set of objects and the relations that hold between them. Meals have a structure because some courses (main) follow other courses (starter). A university class has a structure because some person (lecturer) teaches other people (students). Systems are structures that are dynamic — the parts and structure may change over time. For simplicity, we often think of systems as fixed but most are in flux. Market demand for a product may change based on a variety of socioeconomic factors (trends, wars, pandemics). The composition of milk in Ireland changes in composition as a function of the season and climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerson Wants Food, Person Eats Food, Person Is Nourished\n\n\n\nA possible issue in the nutraloaf case is that the relation between the food and the prisoner is not considered seriously. The food is nutritionally complete (for argument’s sake) but many prisoners do not want to eat it. Defending nutraloaf on the basis that it provides nutrients does not account for the fact that people need to first desire foods in order to then acquire their nutrients. For nutraloaf to function as a food it must also be acceptable to prisoners (it evidently is not).\nThe idea is that the punishment works by depriving the prisoner of enjoyment (sensory blandness) while ensuring they remain healthy (nutritional completeness). However, enjoying food and being nourished by food are tightly coupled (we eat the things we want to eat). We could therefore say:\n\nA food is nourishing if it has a high nutritional quality and is considered desirable to eat\n\n\n\nIn recent times, food scientists have needed to expand the boundaries of the systems they study, especially in the context of sustainability. Previously, a food manufacturer may have simply considered how their raw materials can be converted into products and the profits that can be made from their sale. Today, the manufacturer may need to consider the conditions for the workers that produce the raw materials, the environmental impact of their factory and the health impact of their products. In this way, the ontology of the food scientist has expanded, and they now consider a broader range of objects, relations and structures in their work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is always wise to question our ontological models. Since ancient times thinkers have constructed taxonomies that suggest men are “higher beings” than women. These false ontological models can have negative practical consequences (e.g., the right to vote).\nWhile less immediately controversial, the designers of MyPlate’s decision to distinguish “protein” as a type of food (it is normally considered as a nutrient) from other types (conventional types like fruit) should attract our attention:\n\nwhat is “protein” supposed to represent as a food group?\n\nOther more recently-developed types of food — like convenience food — have escaped easy definitions. Convenience food is often considered to be unhealthy but Jackson et al. (2018: 223) give the example of meal kits, which are convenient for people who want to minimise time spent shopping or planning for their meal while having contents that would not normally be called “convenience foods”."

    "section": "Naturalness",
    "text": "Naturalness\nIn the case of food, asking ‘what is a natural food?’ does not have an obvious scientific answer. It is a matter of how we ‘carve up’ the world into categories so we can mentally process the complexity of the world. This involves ontological reasoning that is implicit (done unconsciously and assumed to be true without question):\n\nThere are natural things and artificial things (ontological categorisation)\nPeople are separate from nature (ontological assumption)\nArtificial things are made by people (ontological definition)\n\nAssuming this is true, many of the things that we value are artificial (furniture, houses, clothing, careers, education, meals). Most people use words like ‘natural’ and ‘artificial’ to describe the world. It is useful, for example, to look at an unspoiled beach and say it is ‘natural’ and a skate park and say it is ‘artificial’, if we are in the business of preserving beaches. Some problems can arise, however, when the distinction is used as a basis to make judgements about what is good and bad. This is because both categories are sufficiently broad that they each encompasses good and bad things (This, 2014):\n\nNatural and good: the alcoholic drink known as ‘wine’ that is generated when grapes are allowed to ferment\nNatural and bad: the anion oxalate that forms a variety of salts in plant-based foods and is associated with gout and kidney stones\nArtificial and good: synthetic vanillin used in the production of 99% of the world’s vanilla-flavoured products\nArtificial and bad: trans fats produced by the industrial process of hydrogenation that is known to have negative health effects\n\nThe assumption that natural things are always good (or bad) is false but so is the assumption that artificial things are always bad (or good). It is preferable therefore in all such cases to be more precise. For example, the following statement is helpful to guide our decision-making:\n\ntrans fats are bad because of their role in contributing to poor cardiovascular health\n\nHowever, the next one is overly general and misleading:\n\npeople should avoid all artificial foods because they are bad for your health\n\n\nOperationalisation\nWe have already seen that ontological concepts like ‘naturalness’ are not scientific. What this means is that they do not emerge from doing science and they are not testable scientifically. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon to hear scientists refer to such concepts, especially when develop technology.\nIn biomimetics it is assumed that there are natural structures that have specific properties that can be useful. Scientists can then study them and design nature-inspired materials that benefit from these useful properties. For example, given the problem of designing a meat-replacer we can first study the structure of meat so that the structure can be replicated.\nThis is an example of operationalisation, where an abstract concept is made more testable or actionable. Here, scientists are not concerned with the (philosophical) question of whether natural things exist. They also do not make the universal (ontological) claim that natural things are better. Instead, the category of natural things is assumed to exist, some of those things are studied to determine their properties and attempts are made to recreate those useful properties in artificial systems.\nNote: in such cases it might be useful to start with an abstract idea, as long as it can be transformed into a more concrete one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Anything Natural?\n\n\n\nThe distinction between natural and artificial is rarely clear-cut.\nConsider this example (Bunge, 2003):\nseed → seedling → sapling → tree → log → pulp → paper → book\nThis is a combination of a natural and an artificial process. Furthermore, given that the seed may have been purposefully planted and its environment manipulated to promote its growth, there is a also a question as to whether the entire process might be artificial."

Specifically, the four elements were thought to correspond to four humours in the body, which were blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. Ancient thinkers thought that excesses or deficiencies in these humours were caused by the levels of consumption of the four elements, and could result in physical or psychological issues.\nOf course, we now know that much of this thinking was metaphysical rather than scientific. The Ancient Greeks were wrong about what composed foods and what composed bodies; however, the general idea that composition involves multiple parts, and that a healthy diet consists of a balance of these multiple parts, was sensible."

So there was some confusion as to why and how a substance containing nitrogen was present in meat.\nGiven that animal meat resembled human muscle, and the general consensus at the time that meat was highly nourishing, scientists began to wonder if a special “animal substance” containing nitrogen was responsible for the high nutritional quality of meat."

All of the dogs became weak and ultimately died.\nFrom this result he concluded that the animal substance was necessary/sufficient for supporting growth and development; however, as he had no positive control (a food containing dietary nitrogen) this claim was speculative. He simply did not have the evidence and his assumption was based on (false) “common sense” that dogs could survive on bread alone. At the urging of the French Academy he repeated the experiment using gelatin. Much to his disappointment, the results indicated that animals could not survive on gelatin.\nIf successful, it was hoped that gelatin could be used effectively as a meal-replacement to feed poor people who could not afford expensive sources of nutrition (like meat). It should be noted that the historical emphasis on dietary protein was (partially) informed by strange, problematic and illogical ideas. For example, the success and wealth of some countries was taken to be caused by their high levels of protein consumption; more obviously, the wealth of these countries simply meant they could more easily afford expensive protein-rich foods."

    "text": "Beyond a Focus on Single Nutrients\nOver the next several hundred years a greater appreciation of human nutrition was developed. The so-called “animal substance” was also found in plant-based materials. Ultimately it was renamed “protein”, representing a set of molecules known for their diversity in structure and behaviour. For example, milk consists of two families of protein: caseins and whey proteins; the caseins are insoluble in acidic conditions while the whey proteins are soluble, which allows their separation. It was found that proteins were comprised of different proportion of smaller parts (amino acids). Early figures who considered protein to be “the only nutrient” were shown to be incorrect. All macronutrients were found to contribute energy in the form of calories. The development of the calorie concept led to an unfortunate de-emphasis of fruits and vegetables initially, as these were considered to be of poor nutritional quality due to their low caloric content. However, this ran counter to the knowledge that diseases like scurvy experiences by sailors could be cured with citrus fruits (which were low in calories). Scientific knowledge of nutrition, and how nutritional foods can be designed, has increased greatly. Occasionally, there have been thinkers that have (mistakenly) placed undue emphasis on a specific nutrient (protein) or property (caloric density) when providing dietary recommendations to the general public; however, most nutritional scientists would now agree that a healthy diet consists of a balance of nutrient sources. When the actual historical trajectory of the sciences of food are studied, the criticisms levelled at scientists as being “obsessed” with single nutrients rings hollow; indeed, there have been some figures that have made this mistake, but the scientific community has generally identified such errors and developed more nuanced accounts of food and nutrition — this is how a healthy science functions as a community to develop better and more correct ideas, but it can be a slow process."

A protein supplement can be useful in the context of attempts to increase athletic performance but it is not a meal-replacer. The chemical complexity of a single citrus fruit or a piece of meat represents a tiny fraction of the complexity of a diverse human diet comprised of multiple foods; for this reason, efforts to create a genuine “meal-replacer” should recognise the magnitude of the challenge involved.\nGelatin was not successful as a meal-replacer but it became successful as an ingredient for enhancing non-nutritional properties of food. For example, it can be used to transform a liquid (solution) into a solid (gel), which creates new textural properties. This is an example of a “techno-functional” as distinct from a “bio-functional” ingredient. It serves some technical function other than (directly) providing nutrition.\nIn recent years, many consumers have sought alternatives to gelatin, due to its animal origin. An important task of food scientist developing a gelled, vegan product — for example — might be finding a protein (or other molecule) from a plant source that serves a similar function."

    "text": "The point was made early in this module that science and technology are two different activities. In its purest form, the goal of science is to develop a more clear understanding of the world. A scientist can study a problem in chemistry — for example — without necessarily thinking about why it might be important “in the real world”. Technology concerns the creation of materials that are useful or that provide some good to the world. Making technology is therefore always normative, as it reflects some idea of making the world better.\nThe scientists and philosopher made some important remarks about the ethics of technology. One of his main observations was that technologists seem to claim credit for the societal goods provided by technology while rejecting any blame for any harms that are caused by technology. For example, when defending food processing many scientists point to the success of technologies like pasteurisation. However, other technologies like hydrogenation have been found to be potentially harmful. To be consistent we must accept that a technology can help but also harm. An awareness of both possibilities makes it more likely that we can work on technologies that are helpful.\n📽️ Direct link to slides for this lecture"

    "text": "Ethical Issues Are Many and Varied\nWhen we think of ethical issues it is often tempting to think of obvious examples. For example, most of us would agree that animals should not be tortured before being slaughtered. Most people agree on this issue and there are laws and regulations in place to stop such practices. Some, however, argue that no animals should be slaughtered for meat because it inflicts needless harm. Others suggest that we must reduce our consumption of animal products to prevent environmental issues that will harm other people. These issues are contested, in that there is not universal agreement on the course of action we should take as a society. These kinds of contested issues often arise when problems are complex, meaning they have multiple interacting components. For example, in this case we might consider:\n\nThe nutritional needs of people\nThe rights and dignity of animals\nCultural traditions around meat-eating\nEconomic motivations to maintain meat production\nEnvironmental problems due to meat production\n\nSomeone might be convinced that there are environmental issues associated with meat production, while finding it difficult to change dietary habits that they have developed since childhood. Another person might agree that killing animals is morally wrong but find it difficult to identify adequate nutritional replacements. A government might wish to encourage companies to develop more sustainable alternatives to meat but be afraid of job losses that might occur if the meat industry is negatively affected."

    "section": "Less Obvious Ethical Issues in Food",
    "text": "Less Obvious Ethical Issues in Food\nThe case of meat production is therefore more complex than preventing the torture of animals. It involves a complex set of questions relating to (at least) the nutritional needs of people, cultural norms around diet, the welfare of animals and the environmental effects of our manufacturing technologies. By looking more closely at some of these cases we can begin to find where food scientists can have a role in these developments.\n\nMilk Alternatives: Not All Created Equal\nThe answer to such problems are rarely “easy”. Take a similar question, which relates to milk alternatives. It is recognised that there are problems associated with water use and methane emissions in dairy production. This has led many to assume that milk alternatives are “more sustainable”. Representatives from the dairy industry, who have a vested interest in the outcome of this debate, suggest that they are inferior.\nRather than “taking sides” here, we need to consider the facts. There is a problem with the environment that is partly due to methane emissions. There is an existing issue with water scarcity, which will be made worse by climate change. Given that dairying is associated with both high levels of water use and methane emissions it is worthwhile considering methods to either solve these problems or find alternatives.\nIn the case of alternatives they are not all created equal. For example, almond milk can be considered to be sub-optimal in some respects. It is associated with high levels of water use and it has a poor nutritional profile.\nIf you are motivated by ethical concerns for finding environmentally-friendly and nutritionally-healthy alternatives to animal-based products then you might need to look beyond your immediate instinct that “plant-based is better”. Instead, you might weigh up what specifically cow’s milk offers to society in its current form and what issues it presents. Looking at the alternatives, which ones are more likely to offer an alternative that is good for the environment, nutritionally strong but also palatable to those who are familiar with the taste of cow milk?\n\n\nCheese Alternatives: Not Good Enough (Yet?)\nTo successfully replace something it is often not sufficient to convince someone of the ethics. For example, it could be argued that a vegan cheese product is a more ethical choice than Cheddar cheese, from the perspective of environmental sustainability and animal welfare. However, as it stands, many vegan cheese products suffer from major sensory issues (i.e., they do not taste very good). This is a major impediment to their widespread uptake in society.\nFood scientists must therefore consider what functionality a traditional cheese product has. Most vegan cheese on the market today contain significant levels of starch and coconut oil. For this reason, they tend to have much lower protein levels than traditional cheese products. Some cheeses like Mozzarella also have a melting behaviour that is expected for specific meals (e.g., pizza). Vegan cheeses containing starch and coconut oil do not melt like Mozzarella, meaning that they are inadequate replacements in this particular case. Food scientists must therefore consider how to alter the composition of vegan cheese so as to improve their nutritional properties as well as their melting behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning an Ethical Problem into a Practical Problem\n\n\n\nDiscussions about the ethics of the problems that we face as a society are important and enriching. However, it can sometimes be important to transform an ethical problem into a practical one that can be solved in a tangible way.\nA really good example of this is the question of speeding. There is a moral argument as to why people should not speed in their cars: it increases the risk of causing harm to people. However, it is unfortunately the case that many people are not convinced by this argument, especially when short-term motivations (enjoying speed, getting somewhere on time) override the ethical concerns.\nHow can this be transformed into a practical problem? Speed bumps. When confronted with a speed bump the driver must think “If I go too fast I will damage my chassis”.\nWhen thinking about ethical issues in food, it can be fruitful to identify convincing ethical arguments (we need to reduce our reliance on animal products) and then transform them into practical problems (we need to make this vegan cheese melt properly).\n\n\n\n\nPersonalised Nutrition: A Question of Autonomy?\nFuture technologies, which are yet to be developed or are under active development, may present new ethical issues. Consider personalised nutrition, a general set of technologies that aims to design our nutritional intake based on biomimetic and genomic data gathered from smart devices and genetic testing. It could be argued that this deprives of us of our autonomy as individuals, in that it limits our capacity to make choices about what we want to eat. There is also a question of how these data might be used against us; for example, if companies have access to data that suggests we have not been disciplined enough in our diet might this impact our ability to access insurance and healthcare?\nThese and many other questions of this kind are beginning to be asked and we need to be aware of them so that we can engage with them intelligently (rather than assuming the technology is simply evil or simply magic).\n\n\nUltraprocessed Foods: Ethics follows Evidence?\nIn class we discussed an executive from the food industry who acted as a “whistle-blower”. This executive felt strongly that the manner in which his company manufactured foods was harmful to society. He called for the food industry to be required to take a more ethical approach to food production. These views are shared by those who advocate for a decreased emphasis on “ultra-processed” foods in the diet. Some argue that the more ethical stance is to manufacture more “minimally-processed” foods.\nHowever, the categories that are used to distinguish these broad classes of food are vague. They are based on notions such as something being “recognisable as whole food”, which are highly subjective. These critics also seem to ignore the context in which foods are consumed. For example, infant formula, Irish whiskey and a meal-replacer might all be defined philosophically as “ultra-processed”; however, whether or not they should be rejected is dependent on the context in which they are used. It might be dificult to justify whiskey consumption by appeals to enjoyment and tradition, given the social and medical consequences of alcohol consumption. However, a meal-replacer — which necessarily requires multiple ingredients and processing steps — is often the only feasible nutrient source for a sick individual.\nA further issue is related to the question of whether there is evidence to support the claim that ultra-processed foods are harmful. If this claim cannot be justified then it is impossible to argue whether there is an ethical “right choice” when it comes to ultra-processing (assuming this is a real category). For example, let’s consider infant formula, whiskey and meal replacers to all be ultra-processed foods. There are many studies that demonstrate that excess consumption of products like whiskey are harmful. Do these studies demonstrate a truth about the problem associated with excess alcohol intake or a problem with ultra-processing in general? The obvious answer seems to be that they tell us something about excess alcohol intake, a fact that generalises to the category of alcoholic drinks in general, but not necessarily ultra-processed foods because this category contains many foods that are not alcoholic in nature."

    "section": "Ethical Frameworks",
    "text": "Ethical Frameworks\nFor centuries, philosophers have debated how we should approach ethical problems. The field of ethics is vast and intricate — it is not possible for us to cover it in detail. However, we will try to introduce the topic so that we are better prepared to explore it in our own time.\nConsider the (in)famous trolley problem. Remember: this thought experiment is not designed to teach you how to react when there is an immediate threat to life. Its purpose is to help us reveal inconsistencies in our thinking so that we can identify potential gaps in our ethical reasoning.\nAn interesting fact (from experience) is that most people would pull a lever to kill one person instead of five. However, the same people would refuse to push a person to their death to save five lives. In the first case people often appeal to a moral principle that is known as utilitarianism, which basically states that we should aim to minimise harm (in this case by sacrificing the one for the many). However, their reaction to the second case violates this principle (they let the one live and the many die). When prompted to explain their reasoning in the second case people struggle and appeal to the vague idea of “not playing a direct role” when pulling a lever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilitarianism\n\n\n\nAn ethical framework in which the ethical act is always the one that improves the well-being of the majority, even if some harm is cause to the minority.\nThe word “utility” generally means the good or pleasure, so utilitarians argue for “maximising utility”.\nSome issues associated with this framework include questions over who (or what) is considered in the moral calculation — for example: should non-human beings and/or future generations be considered? In addition, there are concerns that utilitarian thinking can be used to justify mistreatment of individuals or small groups if it benefits a majority, which many find objectionable. Utilitarians have offered more nuanced versions of this framework in attempts to rectify some of these problems.\n\n\nWhat can be learned from this inconsistency? Well, we seem to absolve ourselves of moral responsibility when our actions and their consequences are mediated (when there is some spatial or temporal distance between our actions and the effect of our actions). We might feel responsible for avoiding food poisoning when making dinner for our friends, but we may feel less responsible when designing a manufacturing process that provides food that could harm many more people — it is critical that we avoid this instinct, if we wish to provide a net good to the world.\nIn the context of business, an ethical framework that is commonly proposed is the idea of self-interest (egoism). For example, we might be worried that a local baker could try to make more profits by replacing a portion of their flour with cheaper sawdust. The argument is that it is useless to tell this baker to stop this activity for ethical reasons; instead, the baker should consider that if people find out, perhaps due to a perceived loss of quality in his goods, then it will affect his business negatively. For this reason, the baker maintains high-standards purely due to his interest in ensuring the survival of his business. It is unclear how such reasoning plays out in the modern context of industrial manufacture, where people are less familiar with how products are made and less likely to detect issues with their production, especially if the consequences are long-term (health).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgoism\n\n\n\nLike utilitarianism, egoism is a consequentialist theory, in that it is justifies its moral arguments on the basis of consequences (usually for people). While utilitiarism is immediately concerned with consequences for the majority, egoism is only concerned with consequences for the individual. Egoists argue that if everyone seeks to maximise the good for themselves (their own “self-interest”) that this will (indirectly) lead to better outcomes for society.\nAn example from Adam Smith — a famous Scottish economist writing in the 1700s – relates to food producers like bakers, butchers and brewers. Smith suggested that a baker might have unethical instincts, such as mixing their flour with sawdust in order to reduce costs and increase profits. However, what can prevent such unethical actions is the baker recognising that in the event that this behaviour was discovered (they are observed or a customer gets sick) then his business (self-interest) would suffer. Smith was writing at a time when a lot of food was purchased from small producers, where — arguably — most consumers were closer to the production of food than they are today. Given that most people do not see what happens in modern food factories and health problems associated with diet are not necessarily immediate, egoism as a guiding ethical principle does not seem fit for purpose. Indeed, the existence of laws and regulations governing the production of food suggest that external controls are often necessary to prevent bad actors seeking to take shortcuts for profit.\n\n\nA more explicit ethical framework, which aims to maximise benefits and minimise harm for the greatest number of people is called utilitarianism. Like egoism, it focuses on the consequences of our actions. Utilitarians, however, consider the consequences for other people and not merely themselves. One issue relating to utilitarianism is challenge in deciding who is considered in the calculation, which things count as harms and which things count as benefits. For example, when some food manufacturing practices are criticised (convenience food, for example) food scientists often argue that it is good that people are given a large choice of options. Here, the critics and the scientists seem to place a different weighting on specific benefits when doing their calculation, with the scientists perhaps emphasising choice and the critics emphasising health in all cases. In discussions around sustainability, the beings we are potentially harming are often somewhat abstract, which presents another challenge to utilitarian thinking; for example, people today may need to make personal sacrifices (foregoing benefits to themselves) in an effort to improve the situation for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeontology\n\n\n\nFrom the Greek deon meaning duty, deontology suggests that we should not directly consider consequences when evaluating ethical decisions. Duty-based ethics often appeal to principles or rules that we should always follow in all circumstances (universal laws). The famous thinker associated with this line of thinking is the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Kant is famous for his “categorical imperative”, which he proposed in different forms. For example, he argued that we should always act so as to treat other people as ends in themselves rather than mere means. In other words, people should be treated with dignity and not just as instruments to improve our own lives. He also argued that when we decide to behave in a specific manner we should at the same time be able to will that everyone else would act in the same way. In other words, if you are about to do something but think in general that it would be bad for others to do the same thing then you should not do it.\nWhen creating technologies we should be cautious about thinking of consumers as mere profit-generating devices. When making a decision to modify a product in some way we should ask whether we can do this while being comfortable with the idea that others would do the same.\n\n\nSome ethical frameworks do not directly consider consequences at all, but rather a respect for duties and rights. This type of ethics is called deontology, and its theoretical underpinnings can be quite difficult to work through in a short amount of time. For now, consider the famous oath taken by young doctors entering the profession, which establishes their ethical duties as involving four principles:\n\nBeneficence: you should actively seek to improve welfare\nNon-maleficence: you should actively seek to avoid inflicting harm\nAutonomy: you should respect the patient’s right to choose a treatment in an informed manner\nJustice: you should aim to provide and distribute help in a fair way\n\nThese duties that apply in all circumstances. Few of us would argue that we would like doctors to throwaway their ethical code when they are responsible for our treatment. It is useful to keep this code in mind when considering ethical issues around food production — should a similar code be adopted? The inter-locking nature of the list is especially interesting. Consider that there is a distinction between improving welfare and avoiding harm; for example, it is not sufficient to merely ensure that a product does not kill or poison, it should also actively improve the lives of those who use it. People should be able to make a free, informed choice between a product and its alternatives, preferably in an informed way. Whatever products that are produced should not only benefit the most privileged in society, but should be distributed fairly and to those who need them most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very brief overview of this area and is designed to get you started thinking about them.\nReadings are provided on Canvas for those of you who wish to read further."

    "text": "Sustainability\nThe concept of sustainability is deeply ethical, in that it concerns how we should act in order to improve the well-being in the face of potentially catastrophic dangers.\nAll concepts of sustainability attempt to tackle these complex challenges by balancing considerations of different interacting sub-systems in the complex system of Earth.\nTypically, this involves a balance of economic, social and environmental factors.\nFor example, when considering the question “is almond milk more sustainable than cow milk?” we might need to consider the impact of a transition to almond milk for — say — the Irish population on the livelihood of dairy farmers (social), the competitiveness of Irish food companies (economic) and the water use and emissions associated with production.\nTaking a balance approach to sustainability, which considers the economic, social and environmental is often represented diagrammatically, which was demonstrated in lectures. For example, sustainability can be defined as the center (union) of their Venn diagram. A nested set of circles can be used to illustrate their strong inter-dependence. They can be depicted as three pillars that together support sustainability, and so on."
