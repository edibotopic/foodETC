    "text": "Preface to the Module\nFood is both astonishingly complex and boringly familiar. That there is a science of food, and that students study this at a university, comes as a great surprise to some people. Yet these same people often have many questions about their own food choices and how their food is manufactured that are difficult to answer using ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù. The effects of diet on health, lifestyle and the environment are some of the most pressing questions facing society today, and the knowledge of food scientists will play a key role in answering them.\nSome of these questions are age-old ‚Äì how can we feed a growing population? ‚Äì others more contemporary ‚Äì do palatable alternatives to animal-based products exist that are less harmful to the environment? ‚Äî and some quite controversial ‚Äì should food choice be determined by personalised data to prevent diet-related disease? A university education will not give you the answers to all of these questions, but it will prepare you to begin finding the answers (or better questions).\nI hope you enjoy the module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Slice\n\n\n\nLike most science degrees, each year of the BSc Food Science builds on the foundation of the previous year. Students might be interested in learning about beer brewing or ice-cream manufacture from day one. However, to appreciate these topics fully one has to master more foundational material, such as:\n\nChemistry (year 1)\nFood engineering (year 2)\nSensory science (year 3)\n\nThen in year 4 a student is considered ready to approach the full complexity of food product to the point that they can develop their own in a systematic fashion\n\nProduct development (year 4)\n\nThe difficulty with this approach for students is that for a long while they can feel out-of-touch with what they came to university to study (in this case food). This module is designed as a vertical slice through the whole degree. Samples of each year, ranging from the fundamentals in year 1 to advanced topics in year 4, are found throughout. The challenge with this approach is that the students have not studied the pre-requisites for the more advanced material. For this reason, a somewhat philosophical approach is adopted, focusing on general concepts, case studies and critical thinking."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nIf there are any errors, ambiguities or omissions in these notes please let me know.\nI can answer any questions you have in class or you can meet me during office hours.\nKeep in mind that you will likely need to revisit notes during the year as the material is covered.\nHistorically, the creation of new knowledge about food has made important contributions to human development. The harnessing of fire in cooking has even been claimed to be a critical moment in the growth of the human brain (Wrangham, 2009). Early developments in preservation, such as salting and smoking, alleviated the survival pressure to continuously find new food. As societies shift from a context of food scarcity to one of food abundance, there can be increased opportunities to focus on other activities, including leisure, creativity and study. This story is a tale of progress but some have argued that problems such as obesity are evidence that we are going backwards. Despite the fact that we all eat, there is not universal agreement on what food is, what is good food and what might become food.\nProfessional food scientists work on a variety of product types. Something like whiskey is not what most people would characterise as ‚Äúfood‚Äù due to its limited nutritional value, yet food scientists do study whiskey. Whiskies have other qualities that are valued by people who consume them (e.g., aroma richness, colour intensity, alcohol content). They must be processed in a very controlled way using operations like distillation to ensure they are safe and consistent. Whiskey and a protein supplement are both studied by food scientists but they have completely different functions. While the supplement has a greater nutritional value it is itself difficult to characterise as ‚Äúfood‚Äù given that it is by definition supplementary to a diet consisting largely of food. If we put aside whether these materials are food and just consider that food scientists are interested in ‚Äúthings that are consumed‚Äù we run into the problem of distinguishing foods from drugs. Indeed, while the food and pharmaceutical industries are distinct there is increasing overlap in some of their products, especially considering the emphasis now placed on biological functions of food products that are beyond basis nutrition.\nNot only is food difficult to define, but what we consider food tends to change. With the introduction of new technologies ‚Äî like 3D printing ‚Äî and new ingredients ‚Äî like insect protein ‚Äî our concept of food is continuously challenged. While scientists and engineers tend to be utopian in their attitude and imagine that all technological development will result in societal progress. Others are dystopian in their outlook, imagining a future in which technology has damaged society and the planet. Dystopianism often coexists with a romantic vision of the past, a better time when we were closer to nature. Before adopting such a philosophy we should try to consider what it means for something to be food.\nThese issues are complex and we want to starting thinking about them in as general terms as possible."

    "section": "Parts and Wholes",
    "text": "Parts and Wholes\nAny system can be described in terms of parts and wholes:\n\nA classroom is a whole consisting of a teacher and students\nA kitchen mixer is a whole consisting of a motor, shaft and paddle\nA salad is a whole consisting of (typically) cold ingredients and dressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I brought a kitchen mixer into the classroom to do a demonstration then the mixer would be a sub-system in the classroom. Two friends who begin to ignore the lecture and start their own conversation also form a sub-system, and so on. Much of reality can be analysed into sub-systems and many systems ‚Äî in this way ‚Äî can be considered super-systems (comprised of multiple sub-systems).\n\n\n\nWhen describing the structure of a system we are interested in the relations between the parts. A relation is just some way that two or more parts form a connection (physically or conceptually). For example, a teacher and a student can be described according to the following relation (in block capitals):\n\nteacher TEACHES student\n\nA motor and shaft in a mixer:\n\nmotor DRIVES shaft\n\nA salad as:\n\ndressing COATS ingredients\n\nAn egg is:\n\nliquid INSIDE shell\n\nIt is always possible to develop a new model for our system. Consider the classroom example, which assumes one-way communication between teacher and student. Below we have a more complex model, describing a case in which student A attends class and is taught by the teacher. The communication is bidirectional, because the student asks and answers questions. Student B did not attend class, so relies on what the other student tells them about the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nteacher\n\n teacher   \n\nstudent A\n\n student A   \n\nteacher->student A\n\n    \n\nstudent A->teacher\n\n    \n\nstudent B\n\n student B   \n\nstudent A->student B\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModels\n\n\n\nModels are representations of reality used to frame a set of problems so that they can be studied effectively.\nA model may be revised as new evidence emerges.\n\n\nIt is common for thinkers to consider two ways of approaching the study of such systems:\n\nHolism: things should be understood by studying the thing as a whole\nReductionism (or ‚Äòindividualism‚Äô): things should be understood by studying their individual parts\n\nReductionism is commonly associated with scientific thinking, which ‚Äî we will see ‚Äî is somewhat of a simplification. The reason for this is that good scientific explanations do not only consider parts, but also how parts relate with each other and the whole in question (through interactions, mechanisms and so on). In this way science is systematic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystemism\n\n\n\nAn approach to studying the world that considers the mechanisms by which parts interact as wholes within a given environment.\nThe object of study is always a system, which can be defined in terms of composition (the parts) and structure (the whole).\nNote that the environment (or context) is critical: ingredients behave differently in different media; foods are tolerated more or less well by different individuals; diets can be more or less successful for different lifestyles.\n\n\nAdvocates of holism commonly consider that important properties of wholes emerge in a manner that is not explainable by reference to their parts. This often leads to assumptions that certain properties are ‚Äî in effect ‚Äî mysterious and unexplainable. As a result, holism is often an unscientific position, as it asserts that there are real, important things that cannot be investigated or understood.\nA food scientist is interested in the qualities that wholes have (is this food product enjoyable?) as well as the mechanisms by which parts determine these qualities (what molecules are associated with this enjoyment?). Food scientists therefore operate at and between two levels:\n\nMacro: the qualities that can be experienced and observed\nMicro: the parts and interactions that culminate in qualities\n\nMoving from macro to micro is analysis (studying the molecular cause of observed food decay). Moving from macro to micro is synthesis (building a model of food decay based on observation and analysis). In science, we constantly move between analysis and synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nmicro\n\n micro   \n\nmacro\n\n macro   \n\nmicro->macro\n\n    \n\nmacro->micro\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nThis concept will be covered in more detail in the Epistemology lectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergence\n\n\n\nEmergence is an ontological concept that suggests that a set of parts when combined can produce a whole with properties not possessed by any of the parts.\nFor example, a \\(H_2O\\) molecule does not have the property of viscosity (resistance to flowing) but when millions of these molecules are combined into a liquid that liquid is observed to have viscosity.\nSimilarly, one person does not have the property of social cohesion, but citizens in a country do have social cohesion when operating as a group of people.\nEmergence is sometimes argued to make reductionism (and science) insufficient to explain reality; however, scientists do not deny emergence and do not attempt to explain emergent properties solely by reference to parts.\nScientists and holists agree that certain qualities seem to ‚Äúemerge‚Äù. The difference is that in science it is assumed that there is an explanation (it may just not have been discovered yet) while in holism it is often assumed that no such explanation can be found.\n\n\n\nBoundaries and Levels\nTo make progress we often need to draw a boundary around the (sub)system that interests us. When working on anything we usually operate within some constraints (e.g., time, money). We may draw a boundary around the macronutrients of food, proteins (P), sugars (S) and lipids (L). In symbols this could be written:\n\\[Food = \\{P,S,L\\}\\]\nThis, however, is quite limited, as food also contains micronutrients, like vitamins (V) and minerals (M):\n\\[Food = \\{[P,C,L],[V,M]\\}\\]\nFood also contains taste (T), flavour (F) and aroma (A) molecules:\n\\[Food = \\{[P,C,L],[V,M],[T,F,A]\\}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meaning of these Symbols\n\n\n\nThese type of equations might be familiar to you from set theory, which everyone studies in school.\nFood can be defined as a set of elements (elements meaning elements of a set rather than chemical element).\nThinking strictly in nutritional terms:\n\\[Food = \\{[P,C,L],[V,M]\\}\\]\nThis means there are two subsets (inside the square brackets) ‚Äî micronutrients (\\(Mi\\)) for the first subset and macronutrients (\\(Ma\\)) for the second. We can then define the nutritional composition of food (\\(F_n\\)) as the union of these subsets:\n\\[F_n = Mi \\cup Ma\\]\nNow assume that we have similar definitions for the structural elements of food (\\(Fs\\)), the psychological elements of food (\\(Fp\\)), the economic elements of food (\\(Fe\\)) and so on (‚Ä¶), we can then define food (\\(F\\)) as:\n\\[F = \\{Fn,Fs,Fp,Fe,...\\}\\]\nYou do not have to learn these equations and will not be examined on your ability to understand them. They allow complex ideas to be expressed in a single line and are useful tools to order our thinking. When thinking through these concepts you might benefit from tis approach.\n\n\nWhen trying to solve a food science problem we can restrict ourselves to chemistry but ‚Äî as discussed in class ‚Äî we can include different aspects of food in our analysis when thinking in terms of physics and biology. For example, in class I mentioned how we can consider bread in terms of its chemical composition (what is its gluten content?), its physical properties (how elastic is it?) but also the biological mechanisms that give it structure (which yeast content will generate the optimal fermentation?).\nFor a moment, let‚Äôs think bigger, and imagine a food product in a supermarket:\n\nThe food has a chemical composition\nThe food has an appearance, perceived by the shopper\nThe food has a format and package, influencing how it can be used\nThe food has a price, which the shopper must be willing to pay\nThe food has competitors that may be more or less preferred\nThe food might have a health claim and this could be true or false\nThe food has been manufactured and transported, giving it an environmental footprint\n\nConsider a case where a consumer sees a product in a shop and considers buying it. The product has been manufactured in an environmentally-friendly way and is rich in a variety of nutrients. However, they recently spoke to their friend who heard a news story about that product causing a case of food poisoning. The consumer does not buy the product because of the perceived risk, even if it meets other criteria (e.g., nutritional quality, environmental sustainability).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n  \n\nfood\n\n food   \n\nshopper A\n\n shopper A   \n\nfood->shopper A\n\n    \n\nsafety risk\n\n safety risk   \n\nfood->safety risk\n\n    \n\nshopper B\n\n shopper B   \n\nshopper A->shopper B\n\n    \n\nshopper B->shopper A\n\n    \n\nnews story\n\n news story   \n\nnews story->shopper B\n\n    \n\nsafety risk->news story\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTo fully understand food as a system, and as a sub-system interacting with other sub-systems, we often need to consider multiple factors. As our time and resources are limited we sometimes need to draw a boundary around a smaller set of things in order to ‚Äî basically ‚Äî get work done. However, when we do this we must not forget that a boundary has been drawn (the map is not the territory).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Analysis: The Map is Not the Territory\n\n\n\nIf food scientists are confronted with a problem that involves particles that sink in a beverage to form a sediment, they may restrict their analysis to:\n\nWhole: suspension of solid particles in liquid\nParts: solid particles, surrounding liquid\n\nThey can then develop a physical solution to the problem: making the particles smaller so that they sink more slowly.\nIn this case there is no advantage to studying the system at a finer scale (molecules) or a larger scale (supermarket). However, the nature of this analysis does not mean that the scientist denies the existence of molecules or supermarkets!\n\n\nThere is a sense in which food is a collection of chemicals, a sense in which it is a physical system, a sense in which it is an economic commodity, and a sense in which it is a source of nutrients for human growth, and a sense in which it is an object of desire. All of these ways of categorising food can be useful. Because we are in a university classroom we have the luxury of thinking big so that we can develop a complex understanding of food. The mathematician Eugenia Cheng in a talk at Google gives an excellent example of thinking in systematic terms about the phenomenon of gaining weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReductionism Involves Small Boundaries, Not Small Components\n\n\n\nReductionism is often associated with thinking in terms of physically small things (atoms, molecules, gears). For example, when it comes to environmental issues it might be suggested that it is reductionist to talk about molecules and we should instead focus on the environment. Molecules are small, the environment is big and the environment contains molecules. The assumption is then that if we focus on studying the bigger thing then we will understand the system fully.\nHowever, a strict focus on molecules and a strict focus on the environment both ‚Äúreduce‚Äù our thinking to a particular level of analysis. By drawing a boundary around observable things in the environment we restrict ourselves to a surface-level understanding of the problem. By drawing a boundary around microscopic things we lose sight of how they make important contributions to the environment.\nWaste from a factory can pollute a river which can be observed to decrease the population of fish. However, it is often the high level of phosphorus in these wastes that causes eutrophication, promoting the growth of algae and ‚Äî in turn ‚Äî depleting oxygen that the fish need to survive.\nUnderstanding the underlying (micro-level) events helps us identify the cause of the (macro-level) problem and develop strategies to prevent its occurrence (not every waste is phosphorus-rich). There is a benefit to integrating the two levels of analysis."

    "section": "Seeking a definition",
    "text": "Seeking a definition\nWhen asked to define an object as seemingly everyday as food many are quick to consult a dictionary. Here, we will generally find something like:\n\na material containing nutrients that when consumed provides an organism with the means to grow\n\nIs this a good definition? Most intuitively answer ‚Äòyes‚Äô. However, when asked to describe favourite foods people will mention things like:\n\nSensory attributes (taste, aroma, flavour, texture, sound)\nContextual factors (sharing food, celebrating with food, food as a reward)\nIngredient pairings (chocolate with caramel, cheese with crackers, beer with chips)\nFunctional properties (muscle building, weight loss, skin health, life extension)\n\nEarlier I indicated that scientists focus on parts while non-scientists focus on wholes ‚Äî this is a simplification that we will need to revisit. In fact, scientists are interested in wholes (or the qualities that wholes are observed to have) but in the following specific ways:\n\nWhat causes certain qualities?\nWhich qualities do people prefer?\nHow can qualities be measured?\n\nNote: while qualities like redness and sweetness are subjective this does not mean that scientists are not interested in them. In fact, as the consumption of food is driven to a great extent by subjective factors, food scientists are greatly interested in these properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: don‚Äôt rely on a dictionary\n\n\n\nDictionaries provide definitions for the common usage of terms in an everyday context.\nThe meaning of a word can change over time. At a given time a word might have an imprecise meaning, or even multiple possible meanings. Some individuals may have a more detailed understanding of a term by ‚Äî for example ‚Äî being experts on a topic.\nYou are in university to develop a deeper knowledge of food than most people. People argue about food in spite of the existence of dictionary definitions. These issues are not settled and we need to think about them carefully.\n\n\nConsider the claim:\n\nfood is a collection of nutrients\n\nIn most cases, food necessarily contains a significant quantity of nutrients. However, it is not the case that food only contains nutrients. The primary constituent of most foods is water, nearly all foods contain bacteria and there is a broad class of other non-nutritional factors (e.g., fibres) that can be studied. Any food scientist that neglects the role of water, bacteria and fibre in food and diet is not doing their job well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater\n\n\n\nFood scientists spend a lot of time studying and manipulating water in food systems. The amount of water in a food is critical in determining the time it takes to rot. The presence of water in specific forms ‚Äî like crystals ‚Äî is also important for the texture of products like ice-cream. Nutritionally, a significant proportion of our water intake is in the form of food.\n\n\nThink about ice-cream for a moment. Why do people buy ice-cream? Usually because they enjoy certain qualities (coldness, melting, sweetness, texture). When is ice-cream frequently served? After a meal (not as the meal).\nNot all food is like ice-cream, in which nutrition is often a secondary consideration. Some foods ‚Äî like infant formula ‚Äî can be considered to serve primarily a nutritional function. However, most foods are selected for a wide variety of reasons (nutrition, sensory, culture, etc.). Narrowing our definition of food to a single class of molecules (nutrients) or properties (taste) leads to a limited understanding of food and reduces our capacity to design foods for different individuals and contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Needs\n\n\n\nIn primary school most of us encountered the distinction between needs and wants. Food is often considered a need, like water, rather than a want like a VR headset. As food is needed for survival, this can lead to the view that as long as a food contributes to survival it is good.\nNow consider some other ‚Äúbase needs‚Äù like clothes and shelter. Certainly, both jackets and houses protect us from our environments. However, think about the actual place where you live or the outfit that you are wearing. Do you think what makes these things ‚Äúgood‚Äù is solely determined by their capacity to protect you from the environment? When you think of how your apartment could be better or what shoes you might prefer are you thinking:\n\nHow will this maximise my capacity to survive in my environment?\n\nThe answer is surely ‚Äòno‚Äô because ‚Äî living in a safe, rich country ‚Äî your survival is effectively ensured. Given that most (though not all) people in a country like Ireland have an adequate supply of nutrients the question is rarely ‚Äòhow will I have enough food to survive?‚Äô but rather ‚Äòwhat foods do I most desire?‚Äô."

If we started listing all of the particularities of different foods, such as redness, freshness, spiciness then we would have a very long list. We would throw our hands up at some point and say ‚Äòit‚Äôs complicated‚Äô. When doing ontology we aim for more general ideas. Redness and spiciness are sensory properties. Foods possess those properties and they can be sensed. Freshness is also a property, but its meaning is less clear (can you think of how it would be sensed?). We could categorise the different kinds of properties that foods have and any properties (like freshness) that seem ill-defined. This would be doing ontology, but the clarity it would provide can help us do science (how will we measure freshness?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects and Relations\n\n\n\nAs an abstract study, ontology can be applied to many different cases:\n\nA family is a set of people (objects) with an ancestry and/or affinity (relations)\nA meal consists of a combination of ingredients (objects) that are edible to people (relation)\nA sentence consists of characters (objects) that can be combined according to syntax rules (relation)\nA mathematical formula consists of symbols like numbers (objects) and operators like addition (relations)\nA diet consists of quantities of specific foods (objects) that satisfy some dietary goals (relations)\n\nThe definitions above have been stipulated by me and you might disagree. For example, you might think that a better account of a meal would include:\n\nAdditional objects (cutlery, plates, courses, drinks, dinner guests, the price)\nAdditional relations (order of courses, food-drink pairings, comfort with setting, familiarity between people)\n\nWhen doing ontology it is possible (in theory) to reach for a full account of a system. Often in science we must draw a boundary somewhere to make the problem tractable.\n\n\nOntology is similar to mathematics in that it involves the abstract study of objects. When doing ontology, however, we usually try to determine what we can say about reality. For most mathematicians, talking about sets or numbers does not mean that these objects exist physically. Mathematics is neutral with respect to reality and is only concerned with mathematical objects.\nAt a very basic level ontology concerns two kinds of thing:\n\nObjects\nRelations\n\nFrom these simple types of things we can reason about a lot, including structures and systems. The question what is an emulsion? is answered by considering the objects (oil and water) and the relations (the oil is dispersed in the water). An emulsion is a structure that is defined as a dispersion of oil and water. This structure has important properties ‚Äî it can dissolve both water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxonomies and Food Pyramids\n\n\n\nA taxonomy that you encounter in biology is a kind of ontological model. Typically, a taxonomy classifies objects into a hierarchy. This means between any two objects there is an order (\\(x\\) is either higher or lower than \\(y\\)). In a biological taxonomy the highest level (or ‚Äòrank‚Äô) is the most general while the lowest is the least general. Plants and animals share general attributes of Life, but a red fox and a white rose have different attributes as different Species.\nThe traditional food pyramid is an ontology of this kind ‚Äî but objects at the lowest level (fruits, veg) are considered more foundational to the diet. A less common type of model is a meronomy, which classifies objects on the basis of parthood. MyPlate, a replacement for the food pyramid, consists of a meal (the whole) and its parts (fruits, grains, veg, protein, dairy). This model attempts to establish what the necessary components should be for every meal. Revisions to the food pyramid have taken place multiple times over the decades. There continues to be debate over this issue because people disagree over what factors are important when categorising food. For example, increasingly there are calls to include environmental impact in such classifications.\n\n\nA structure is simply a set of objects and the relations that hold between them. Meals have a structure because some courses (main) follow other courses (starter). A university class has a structure because some person (lecturer) teaches other people (students). Systems are structures that are dynamic ‚Äî the parts and structure may change over time. For simplicity, we often think of systems as fixed but most are in flux. Market demand for a product may change based on a variety of socioeconomic factors (trends, wars, pandemics). The composition of milk in Ireland changes in composition as a function of the season and climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerson Wants Food, Person Eats Food, Person Is Nourished\n\n\n\nA possible issue in the nutraloaf case is that the relation between the food and the prisoner is not considered seriously. The food is nutritionally complete (for argument‚Äôs sake) but many prisoners do not want to eat it. Defending nutraloaf on the basis that it provides nutrients does not account for the fact that people need to first desire foods in order to then acquire their nutrients. For nutraloaf to function as a food it must also be acceptable to prisoners (it evidently is not).\nThe idea is that the punishment works by depriving the prisoner of enjoyment (sensory blandness) while ensuring they remain healthy (nutritional completeness). However, enjoying food and being nourished by food are tightly coupled (we eat the things we want to eat). We could therefore say:\n\nA food is nourishing if it has a high nutritional quality and is considered desirable to eat\n\n\n\nIn recent times, food scientists have needed to expand the boundaries of the systems they study, especially in the context of sustainability. Previously, a food manufacturer may have simply considered how their raw materials can be converted into products and the profits that can be made from their sale. Today, the manufacturer may need to consider the conditions for the workers that produce the raw materials, the environmental impact of their factory and the health impact of their products. In this way, the ontology of the food scientist has expanded, and they now consider a broader range of objects, relations and structures in their work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is always wise to question our ontological models. Since ancient times thinkers have constructed taxonomies that suggest men are ‚Äúhigher beings‚Äù than women. These false ontological models can have negative practical consequences (e.g., the right to vote).\nWhile less immediately controversial, the designers of MyPlate‚Äôs decision to distinguish ‚Äúprotein‚Äù as a type of food (it is normally considered as a nutrient) from other types (conventional types like fruit) should attract our attention:\n\nwhat is ‚Äúprotein‚Äù supposed to represent as a food group?\n\nOther more recently-developed types of food ‚Äî like convenience food ‚Äî have escaped easy definitions. Convenience food is often considered to be unhealthy but Jackson et al.¬†(2018: 223) give the example of meal kits, which are convenient for people who want to minimise time spent shopping or planning for their meal while having contents that would not normally be called ‚Äúconvenience foods‚Äù."

    "text": "Naturalness\nIn the case of food, asking ‚Äòwhat is a natural food?‚Äô does not have an obvious scientific answer. It is a matter of how we ‚Äòcarve up‚Äô the world into categories so we can mentally process the complexity of the world. This involves ontological reasoning that is implicit (done unconsciously and assumed to be true without question):\n\nThere are natural things and artificial things (ontological categorisation)\nPeople are separate from nature (ontological assumption)\nArtificial things are made by people (ontological definition)\n\nAssuming this is true, many of the things that we value are artificial (furniture, houses, clothing, careers, education, meals). Most people use words like ‚Äònatural‚Äô and ‚Äòartificial‚Äô to describe the world. It is useful, for example, to look at an unspoiled beach and say it is ‚Äònatural‚Äô and a skate park and say it is ‚Äòartificial‚Äô, if we are in the business of preserving beaches. Some problems can arise, however, when the distinction is used as a basis to make judgements about what is good and bad. This is because both categories are sufficiently broad that they each encompasses good and bad things (This, 2014):\n\nNatural and good: the alcoholic drink known as ‚Äòwine‚Äô that is generated when grapes are allowed to ferment\nNatural and bad: the anion oxalate that forms a variety of salts in plant-based foods and is associated with gout and kidney stones\nArtificial and good: synthetic vanillin used in the production of 99% of the world‚Äôs vanilla-flavoured products\nArtificial and bad: trans fats produced by the industrial process of hydrogenation that is known to have negative health effects\n\nThe assumption that natural things are always good (or bad) is false but so is the assumption that artificial things are always bad (or good). It is preferable therefore in all such cases to be more precise. For example, the following statement is helpful to guide our decision-making:\n\ntrans fats are bad because of their role in contributing to poor cardiovascular health\n\nHowever, the next one is overly general and misleading:\n\npeople should avoid all artificial foods because they are bad for your health\n\n\nOperationalisation\nWe have already seen that ontological concepts like ‚Äònaturalness‚Äô are not scientific. What this means is that they do not emerge from doing science and they are not testable scientifically. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon to hear scientists refer to such concepts, especially when develop technology.\nIn biomimetics it is assumed that there are natural structures that have specific properties that can be useful. Scientists can then study them and design nature-inspired materials that benefit from these useful properties. For example, given the problem of designing a meat-replacer we can first study the structure of meat so that the structure can be replicated.\nThis is an example of operationalisation, where an abstract concept is made more testable or actionable. Here, scientists are not concerned with the (philosophical) question of whether natural things exist. They also do not make the universal (ontological) claim that natural things are better. Instead, the category of natural things is assumed to exist, some of those things are studied to determine their properties and attempts are made to recreate those useful properties in artificial systems.\nNote: in such cases it might be useful to start with an abstract idea, as long as it can be transformed into a more concrete one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Anything Natural?\n\n\n\nThe distinction between natural and artificial is rarely clear-cut.\nConsider this example (Bunge, 2003):\nseed ‚Üí seedling ‚Üí sapling ‚Üí tree ‚Üí log ‚Üí pulp ‚Üí paper ‚Üí book\nThis is a combination of a natural and an artificial process. Furthermore, given that the seed may have been purposefully planted and its environment manipulated to promote its growth, there is a also a question as to whether the entire process might be artificial."
