    "text": "Preface to the Module\nFood is both astonishingly complex and boringly familiar. That there is a science of food, and that students study this at a university, comes as a great surprise to some people. Yet these same people often have many questions about their own food choices and how their food is manufactured that are difficult to answer using ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù. The effects of diet on health, lifestyle and the environment are some of the most pressing questions facing society today, and the knowledge of food scientists will play a key role in answering them.\nSome of these questions are age-old ‚Äì how can we feed a growing population? ‚Äì others more contemporary ‚Äì do palatable alternatives to animal-based products exist that are less harmful to the environment? and some quite controversial ‚Äì should food choice be determined by personalised data to prevent diet-related disease? A university education will not give you the answers to all of these questions, but it will prepare you to begin finding the answers (or better questions).\nI hope you enjoy the module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Slice\n\n\n\nLike most science degrees, each year of the BSc Food Science builds on the foundation of the previous year. Students might be interested in learning about beer brewing or ice-cream manufacture from day one. However, to appreciate these topics fully one has to master more foundational material, such as:\n\nChemistry (year 1)\nFood engineering (year 2)\nSensory science (year 3)\n\nThen in year 4 a student is considered ready to approach the full complexity of food product to the point that they can develop their own in a systematic fashion\n\nProduct development (year 4)\n\nThe difficulty with this approach for students is that for a long while they can feel out-of-touch with what they came to university to study (in this case food). This module is designed as a vertical slice through the whole degree. Samples of each year, ranging from the fundamentals in year 1 to advanced topics in year 4, are found throughout. The challenge with this approach is that the students have not studied the pre-requisites for the more advanced material. For this reason, a somewhat philosophical approach is adopted, focusing on general concepts, case studies and critical thinking."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lots of people know how to cook. Everyone has their favourite meal. We have all been eating and drinking for most of our lives.\nWhat then is different about how a food scientist knows about food?\nA classic distinction that is useful when thinking about this question is that between two ways of knowing:\n\nProcedural knowledge (knowing how)\nDeclarative knowledge (knowing that)\n\n\n\nProcedural knowledge is associated with following sets of instructions. For example, it is possible to cook a good meal by simply following a recipe. This is not too different to mechanically following a laboratory protocol.\nThis way of knowing is often acquired through experience. Someone may know the steps required to achieve a goal but not why the steps work. An issue with this kind of knowledge is that it is difficult to teach. When asking someone why a step works they might respond ‚Äúit just works‚Äù. Another problem with this is that it is relatively inflexible and when the procedure is found to falter or fail it can be difficult to modify.\n\n\n\nDeclarative knowledge is knowledge that can be expressed clearly in speech or writing. When a scientist outlines the steps in a laboratory method it is preferable if they can explain the purpose of each step. Consider a method with a step that involves adding a dangerous acid ‚Äî a legitimate question might be:\n\nDo we really need the step with the dangerous acid?\n\nTo answer the question we need to know what the mechanism of the acid is supposed to be. Alternatively we could remove the step and see if the method still works.\nKnowledge of how something works better enables us to explain it other people (students, employees, managers). It also means that we are typically more flexible when a problem arises (there might be a non-acidic material that works the same way).\nThe declarative knowledge characteristic of science is usually also generalisable, meaning that once we know some set of facts about a phenomenon we are able to extend that knowledge over a wide variety of cases.\nAs a scientist, technologist or designer you need both procedural and declarative knowledge; however, many students think that knowing how is sufficient. This can restrict your thinking and your career path, as it is often necessary to question that procedures that are in place, even when they have been there for a long time.\n\n\n\nA classic case that helps us explore this distinction is the searing of meat. It is still common today for recipes to suggest that cooks ‚Äúsear meat‚Äù. This is a common step that is followed to produce juicy meat (a procedure).\nWhen chefs explained why meat should be seared they suggested that it ‚Äúsealed in‚Äù the juices. This explanation is somewhat metaphorical, and is similar to the ancient surgical technique of cauterisation by burning. While effective searing does produce delicious meat it is not because juices are sealed in through the formation of a skin.\nHere, there is a problem with the declarative knowledge used to explain the step. This knowledge is assumed uncritically, informed by metaphors and has never been tested. These three reasons alone make the knowledge somewhat unscientific.\nRecently, scientists began to study the operation of searing. They measured the loss of moisture from meat that had been seared and meat that had not. It was found that searing ‚Äî in fact ‚Äî accelerates the loss of moisture.\nThese scientists knew that searing was desirable (it produced a good effect) but it was not for the reasons commonly outlined. Instead, they suggested that the high temperatures used during searing promoted other effects ‚Äî especially Maillard browning ‚Äî that were responsible for the positive attributes of seared meat.\nMaillard browning is a well understood chemical reaction that occurs in a wide variety of food systems. In some it is undesirable (infant formula) and in others it is desirable (baked goods). It is known that the effect is promoted by certain conditions (e.g., alkaline pH); hence, obvious questions emerged, such as whether changing pH could improve the quality of cooked meat. In addition, scientists returned to the original stated goal of searing (sealing the juices) and wondered how this could be achieved while also promoting browning.\nThe answer is known as sous vide cooking, where meat is first cooked at low temperature in a sealed pouch before then being briefly seared. Most of the cooking is done in the pouch where moisture loss is minimal while the searing can still achiever the browning effect.\nConsidering this case a few important points to consider are:\n\nKnowing the true mechanism of searing allowed the development of more optimal techniques\nScientific knowledge of the Maillard browning reaction allows us to generalise to a variety of cases"

    "text": "Reductionsim and Holism\nThere has been some debate in recent years about the reductionsim of food and nutritional science. Critics suggest that scientists should try to be more holistic. These terms are often ill-defined, but from what we have just discussed we can begin to think through them. We have listed four categories ‚Äî matter, form, process and function. To be reductionist is to emphasise one over the others at the expense of understanding the object of study. To be reductionist is to seek explanations that give weighting to all four, or at least these four.\nJust like matter, form, process and function are all just different categories by which we can think about food (at different scales), we can also differentiate between kinds of reductionism that correspond to these categories. The resulting ‚Äú-isms‚Äù might be:\n\nMaterialism: focusing on how the matter in food influences its properties\nStructuralism: focusing on how the structure of food influences its properties\nCausalism: focusing on how processing causes changes in food properties\nFunctionalism: focusing on the final function served by food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe most prominent kind of materialism is ‚Äúnutritional reductionism‚Äù or ‚Äúnutritionism‚Äù for short.\nNutritionism is usually framed as a criticism, which suggests that scientists focus too much on nutrients while neglecting other aspects of food that are important.\nA central goal of this course if exploring this claim by trying to understand what food scientists actually think about."

The early harnessing of fire as a cooking ‚Äôtechnology‚Äô by hunter-gatherers has been linked to dramatic changes in human brain development. Development of preservation technologies, such as salt and smoke, alleviated the pressure to continually find new food, which allowed people to settle into large communities. Food cultures developed that remain specific to different regions of the world, and come to define (in part) what it means to be a member of a society. Despite the fact that we all eat, there is not necessarily universal agreement on what is food, what is not food and what might become food."

    "section": "Seeking a definition",
    "text": "Seeking a definition\nWhen asked to define an object as seemingly everyday as food many students are quick to consult a dictionary. Here, they will generally find something like:\n\na material containing nutrients that when consumed provides an organism with the means to grow\n\nIs this a good definition? Most students intuitively answer ‚Äòyes‚Äô. However, when asked to describe their favourite food they will mention things like:\n\nSensory attributes\nContextual factors\nIngredient pairings\nFunctional properties\n\nEarlier I indicated that scientists focus on parts while non-scientists focus on qualities ‚Äî this is a simplification that we will need to revisit. In fact, scientists are interested in qualities but in the following specific ways:\n\nWhat causes certain qualities?\nWhich qualities do people prefer?\nHow can qualities be measured?\n\nThis is a point that we will need to return to several times because it results in much confusion. It is a gross simplification to claim that food scientists are only interested in what molecules are in a food and measuring their levels. When we consider that most food scientists design products for people this characterisation becomes even weaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: don‚Äôt rely on a dictionary\n\n\n\nDictionaries provide definitions for the common usage of terms in an everyday context.\nThe meaning of a word can change over time. At a given time a word might have an imprecise meaning, or even multiple possible meanings. Some individuals may have a more detailed understanding of a term by ‚Äî for example ‚Äî being experts on a topic.\nYou are in university to develop a deeper knowledge of food than most people. People argue about food in spite of the existence of dictionary definitions. These issues are not settled and we need to think about them carefully.\n\n\nConsider the claim:\n\nfood is a collection of nutrients\n\nIs this true?\nNo.\nIn most cases, food necessarily contains a significant quantity of nutrients. However, it is not the case that food only contains nutrients.\nThe primary constituent of most foods is water, nearly all foods contain bacteria and there is a broad class of other non-nutritional factors (e.g., fibres) that play a huge role in determining important properties of food.\nFood scientists spend a lot of time and energy on the state of water in a food system. The amount of water in a food is critical in determining the time it takes to rot. The presence of water in specific forms ‚Äî like crystals ‚Äî is also important for the texture of products like ice-cream.\nThink about ice-cream for a moment. Why do people buy ice-cream? Usually because they enjoy certain qualities (coldness, melting, sweetness, texture). When is ice-cream frequently served? After a meal.\nThe fact that ice-cream contains nutrients is secondary consideration to its sensory properties.\nNot all food is like ice-cream. Some foods ‚Äî like infant formula ‚Äî can be considered to serve primarily a nutritional function.\nHowever, most foods are selected for a wide variety of reasons (nutrition, sensory, culture, etc.). Narrowing our definition of food to a single class of molecules (nutrients) leads to a limited understanding of food and reduces our capacity to design foods for different individuals and contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Needs\n\n\n\nIn primary school most of us encountered the distinction between needs and wants. Food is often considered a need, like water, rather than a want like a VR headset. As food is needed for survival, this can lead to the view that as long as a food contributes to survival it is good.\nNow consider some other ‚Äúbase needs‚Äù like clothes and shelter. Certainly, both jackets and houses protect us from our environments. However, think about the actual place where you live or the outfit that you are wearing. Do you think what makes these things ‚Äúgood‚Äù is solely determined by their capacity to protect you from the environment? When you think of how your apartment could be better or what shoes you might prefer are you thinking:\n\nHow will this maximise my capacity to survive in my environment?\n\nThe answer is surely ‚Äòno‚Äô because ‚Äî living in a safe, rich country ‚Äî your survival is effectively ensured. Given that most (though not all) people in a country like Ireland have an adequate supply of nutrients the question is rarely ‚Äòhow will I have enough food to survive?‚Äô but rather ‚Äòwhat foods do I most desire?‚Äô."

    "text": "Ontology\nFor now, we are seeking general ideas about food rather than particular ones. If we started listing all of the particularities of food, such as redness, freshness, spiciness then we would have a very long list. We would throw our hands up at some point and say ‚Äòit‚Äôs complicated‚Äô. Better to identify some general categories so that we can organise particular properties under those categories. This is what ontology involves.\nOntology is similar to mathematics in that it involves the abstract study of objects. When doing ontology, however, we usually try to determine what we can say about reality. For most mathematicians, talking about sets or numbers does not mean that these objects exist physically. Mathematics is neutral with respect to reality and is only concerned with mathematical objects.\nAt a very basic level ontology concerns two kinds of thing:\n\nObjects\nRelations\n\nFrom these simple types of things we can reason about a lot, including structures and systems. The question what is an emulsion? is answered by considering the objects (oil and water) and the relations (the oil is dispersed in the water). An emulsion is a structure that is defined as a dispersion of oil and water. This structure has important properties ‚Äî it can dissolve both water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxonomies and Food Pyramids\n\n\n\nA taxonomy that you encounter in biology is a kind of ontological model. Typically, a taxonomy classifies objects into a hierarchy. This means between any two objects there is an order (\\(x\\) is either higher or lower than \\(y\\)). In a biological taxonomy the highest level (or ‚Äòrank‚Äô) is the most general while the lowest is the least general. Plants and animals share general attributes of Life, but a red fox and a white rose have different attributes as different Species.\nThe traditional food pyramid is an ontology of this kind ‚Äî but objects at the lowest level (fruits, veg) are considered more foundational to the diet. A less common type of model is a meronomy, which classifies objects on the basis of parthood. MyPlate, a replacement for the food pyramid, consists of a meal (the whole) and its parts (fruits, grains, veg, protein, dairy). This model attempts to establish what the necessary components should be for every meal. Revisions to the food pyramid have taken place multiple times over the decades. There continues to be debate over this issue because people disagree over what factors are important when categorising food. For example, increasingly there are calls to include environmental impact in such classifications.\n\n\nA structure is simply a set of objects and the relations that hold between them. Meals have a structure because some courses (main) follow other courses (starter). A university class has a structure because some person (lecturer) teaches other people (students). Systems are structures that are dynamic (they change over time). For simplicity, we often think of systems as fixed (into systems) but most are in flux.\nA key concept when defining any system (or sub-system) is the system boundary. It is not possible for us to think about everything, so we usually have to draw a boundary around the system we are interested in. For example, a latte is a hot coffee beverage containing caffeine and milk that is slightly bitter and has a strong aroma. We can draw a boundary around to the coffee so that we can study it as a mixture of water, caffeine and milk components. In reality, however, the system is more complex. The coffee beans were harvested in Africa, the coffee was extracted by the barista, the aroma and taste are experienced by the customer. A full ontology of this system would account for all of these objects and relations. In practice, we often have to narrow the scope of inquiry but this does not mean that the factors we have excluded do not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA possible issue in the nutraloaf case is that the relation between the food and the prisoner is not considered seriously. The food is nutritionally complete (for argument‚Äôs sake) but many prisoners do not want to eat it. Defending nutraloaf on the basis that it provides nutrients does not account for the fact that people need to desire foods in order to acquire their nutrients. For nutraloaf to function as a food it must also be acceptable to prisoners (it evidently is not).\nThe idea is that the punishment works by depriving the prisoner of enjoyment (sensory blandness) while ensuring they remain healthy (nutritional completeness). However, enjoying food and being nourished by food are tightly coupled (we eat the things we want to eat).\n\n\nFood scientists in nearly all cases must consider how the product relates to the consumer. The chemical interaction between coffee and milk might be important because it affects the consumer experience. Often we have to be specific about this: perhaps the bitterness of the coffee is reduced by the presence of milk.\nIn recent times, food scientists have needed to expand their boundaries even further, especially in the context of sustainability. For example, the working conditions for the coffee supplier might need to be considered. In addition, the environmental impact of the milk source might be important. Thus, the range of objects we consider and how they relate in the system we are studying can become narrower or borader depending on the context of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is always wise to question our ontological models. Since ancient times thinkers have constructed taxonomies that suggest men are higher beings than women. Most of us now (rightly) reject this idea.\nWhile less controversial, the designers of MyPlate‚Äôs decision to distinguish a class called ‚Äúprotein‚Äù (normally considered as a nutrient) from other classes (which are all categories of food) should attract our attention:\n\nwhat is ‚Äúprotein‚Äù supposed to represent as a food group?"

    "text": "Ontology and Science\nWhat is the difference between science and ontology? Like most areas of knowledge there is some overlap. One of the easiest (but not uncontroversial) distinctions is that scientific problems are usually testable while ontological problems can only be dealt with through reasoning. Many important scientific questions start, however, as ontological problems. Philosophers thought about atoms centuries before it was possible to determine scientifically if they existed.\nOntological reductionism is the view that any structure of system can be described by reference to its parts. For example, to describe what water is it is sufficient to know about the objects (individual water molecules). A scientist might have this ontological assumption about the world and it will likely influence the focus of their work. They may ‚Äî for example ‚Äî focus on isolating molecules to understand their properties separate from the bulk. However, this kind of reductionism is usually not sufficient to describe a system well. For example, there are forces that act between water molecules and there are social bonds that occur between people. Attempting to describe the behaviour of water or crowds by focusing on isolated molecules or individuals will not lead to good explanations.\nIt is also important to understand that molecules can interact to produce qualities that individual molecules do not possess. Sugars interact to form crystals. Proteins and sugars interact to generate brown pigments. Polysaccharides and water interact to increase viscosity. For this reason alone most food scientists are not ontological reductionists ‚Äî they do not think knowledge of molecules is sufficient to understand food. At a minimum, most food scientist consider molecules and the relations that hold between them: how these molecules interact, what influence they have on each other and how they form structures."

    "text": "Ontology and Nature\nIn the case of food, asking ‚Äòwhat is a natural food?‚Äô does not have an obvious scientific answer. It is a matter of how we ‚Äòcarve up‚Äô the world into categories so we can mentally process the complexity of the world. This involves ontological reasoning that is implicit (done unconsciously and assumed to be true without question):\n\nThere are natural things and artificial things\nPeople are separate from nature\nArtificial things are made by people\n\nAssuming this is true, many of the things that we value are artificial (furniture, houses, clothing, careers, education, meals). Most people use words like ‚Äònatural‚Äô and ‚Äòartificial‚Äô to describe the world. It is useful, for example, to look at an unspoiled beach and say it is ‚Äònatural‚Äô and a skate park and say it is ‚Äòartificial‚Äô. Some problems arise when the distinction is used as a basis to make judgements about what is good and bad. This is because both categories are sufficiently broad that they each encompasses good and bad things:\n\nNatural and good: the alcoholic drink known as ‚Äòwine‚Äô that is generated when grapes are allowed to ferment\nNatural and bad: the anion oxalate that forms a variety of salts in plant-based foods and is associated with gout and kidney stones\nArtificial and good: synthetic vanillin used in the production of 99% of the world‚Äôs vanilla-flavoured products\nArtificial and bad: trans fats produced by the industrial process of hydrogenation that is known to have negative health effects\n\nThe assumption that natural things are always good (or bad) is false but so is the assumption that artificial things are always bad (or good). It is preferable therefore in all such cases to be more precise. For example, the following statement is productive:\n\ntrans fats are bad because of their role in contributing to poor cardiovascular health\n\nHowever, the next one is overly general and misleading:\n\npeople should avoid all artificial foods because they are bad for your health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisions\n\n\n\nRomanticism is a view that life was better when there was less technology and people were closer to nature. It assumes that life was better in the past despite evidence to the contrary (e.g., average life expectancy was lower).\nUtopianism is a view that life will be better in the future once we have adopted more and better technologies. It assumes that the introduction of new technology always yields a positive outcome despite counter-examples (e.g., hydrogenation was a failed technology with respect to human health).\nBoth of these ways of thinking are visions and are not based on evidence or sound reasoning. Again, we can benefit here from thinking of particular cases.\nFor example:\n\nWhat specific traditional practice from the past might be useful today and why?\nWhat specific future technology might be useful and why?\n\n3D printing is an exciting technology but it is not ‚Äòdestined‚Äô to succeed merely because it is new."

What this means is that they do not emerge from doing science and they are not testable scientifically. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon to hear scientists refer to such concepts.\nIn biomimetics it is assumed that there are natural structures that have specific properties that can be useful. Scientists can then study them and design nature-inspired materials that benefit from these useful properties. For example, given the problem of designing a meat-replacer we can first study the structure of meat so that the structure can be replicated.\nThis is an example of operationalisation, where an abstract concept is made more testable or actionable. Here, scientists are not concerned with the (philosophical) question of whether natural things exist. They also do not make the universal (ontological) claim that natural things are better. Instead, the category of natural things is assumed to exist, some of those things are studied to determine their properties and attempts are made to recreate those useful properties in artificial systems.\nNote: in such cases it might be useful to start with an abstract idea, as long as it can be transformed into a more concrete one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects and Relations\n\n\n\nAs an abstract study, ontology can be applied to many different cases:\n\nA family is a set of people (objects) with an ancestry and/or affinity (relations)\nA meal consists of a combination of ingredients (objects) that are edible to people (relation)\nA sentence consists of characters (objects) that can be combined according to syntax rules (relation)\nA mathematical formula consists of symbols like numbers (objects) and operators like addition (relations)\nA diet consists of quantities of specific foods (objects) that satisfy some dietary goals (relations)\n\nThe definitions above have been stipulated by me and you might disagree. For example, you might think that a better account of a meal would include:\n\nAdditional objects (cutlery, plates, courses, drinks, dinner guests, the price)\nAdditional relations (order of courses, food-drink pairings, comfort with setting, familiarity between people)\n\nWhen doing ontology it is possible (in theory) to reach for a full account of a system.

To Aristotle, this was a reductive explanation. In his writings he considered everyday objects like statues and asked:\nHe suggested that such questions are usually answered with an appeal to four causes.

He also thought that the object‚Äôs telos (Greek for end or function) is also essential to any description.\nSome statues were crafted to pay homage to a great citizen, others in praise of a God and others to ridicule a defeated enemy.

As a food scientist you can make changes to one or more aspects in the hope of achieving thos goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAristotle was a great thinker and continues to influence scientists, philosophers and mathemiticians today. However, there have always been those that disagree with his ideas and we must be careful not to extend them to areas where they do not work.\nIn ancient times the main opponents to Aristotle‚Äôs views were the atomists who consider atoms (matter) to be sufficient to explain all things. Many years later, Francis Bacon ‚Äî considered to be the founder of the modern scientific method ‚Äî rejected the formal and final (function) causes and urged scientists to focus on matter (e.g., atoms, molecules) and process (e.g., heat, motion).\nA significant rejection of Aristotle‚Äôs ideas occured in biology with the discovery of evolution. Aristotle would suggest that an animal had a specific telos that governed its development; however, evolutionary biology maintains that animals develop through random genetic mutations and natural selection.\nModels like the four causes are not ‚Äúscientific theories‚Äù as we normally understand them. They are heuristics or rules-of-thumb that guide us in our thinking.\nVersions of the four causes are most commonly found among designers who are in the business of creating clothes, buildings, software, furniture, lessons and any other thing you can imagine that people use or consume. Of course, food scientists in their own way are designers also, because they make things that people should want to eat. Many of the examples Aristotle gave in his original works were of things people made (statues, tables) rather than natural things (animals, plants).\nWhen using the four causes as a heuristic, it is important to keep in mind that it is most appropriate when guiding how we approach questions concerning technology (making things for people) rather than science (understanding nature) per se.\n\n\nFood products are technologies, engineered in all cases for ultimate consumption by humans; any technology is a cultural artifact, which is shaped by, and itself shapes, culture; the designer of a technol- ogy bears an ethical responsibility to the user of that technology. From the preceding something becomes apparent ‚Äì food scientists are not ‚Äôjust‚Äô scientists, they are often some amalgam of scientist, engineer and designer. Once we recognise the essence of what we do, we can understand better what we could do and what we should do to benefit society."

Butter, grain and milk powder sold by one company is considered as good as that sold by another. It is difficult to achieve market differentiation for such materials, so producers mostly aim to increase their efficiency and volume of production.\nCompanies can attain high margins for novel ingredients or products that have not attained commodity status. For example, cheddar cheese is a commodity and so is the whey powder obtained by drying its liquid byproduct. Whey protein concentrates, which have been a massive commercial success in recent years, are increasingly viewed as commodities. Dairy companies are increasingly looking at more and more specialised fractions from whey that can be sold at higher margins.\nThere are a series of trade-offs here. Such materials command high costs but can only be produced at small volumes. The cost of producing the material may be high and require specialised equipment. A consumer base may not have been developed. It is key in such cases that the material is produced as efficiently as possible and that ‚Äî above all ‚Äî it functions as it is supposed to."

This means that it is primarily based on the notion of connection. For example, this is how we might think of a dispersion of oil and water:\n\nThere are two unique components\nThe oil is divided into multiple parts that do not connect\nEvery surface point of the oil is connected with water\nNot every surface point of the water is connected with oil\nThe oil is therefore discrete and the water continuous\n\nThe logic is encoded in the formula \\(O/W\\).\nBelow you can use a simple app to generate random food structures using this method.

    "text": "Reading text has been the primary method of acquiring knowledge for much of human history. Scientists learn new ideas by reading journal articles, the public learns about current events in newspapers. If you want to learn about a new topic you might start with Wikipedia, but to really learn you probably need a good book. To prepare for my lectures I read from all of these sources and if you have ever watched a good Youtube video they probably have too.\nAs a student you must read, even when it is hard. There are two families of problems students face when reading. The first relates to problems of interest, motivation and enthusiasm. These are age-old psychological tests that you must learn to overcome. The second relates to problems of sourcing trustworthy information. These are new problems that must be navigated in the era of the internet.\nYour first instinct might be that anything in print is authorative. Consider the following sources of information:\n\nTweets\nBlogs\nNewspaper reports\nJournal articles\nPress releases from universities\nBooks by famous professors\n\nAny of these sources could potentially contain factual and interesting information. If the source contains a coherant, logical argument it can be evaluated on its merits. For example, a blog that outlines an effective way to cook a turkey is probably reliable, if it contains sound advice (cooking the meat through), measurements (target temperatures) and results (photographs of the results). Similarly, a Tweet that outlines how to solve a mathematical equation is trustworthy if it reliably yields the correct result (meaning the logic was valid). Most people do quite well cooking and calculating with recipes found on the internet.\nNewspapers typically have editorial standards that make them more rigorous than a blog, Tweet or TikTok. For example, if a journalist is making a factual statement they are expected to have a reliable source, such as a witness. When submitting their article for publication the editors of the journal will check if such standards have been met. However, these standards are internal to the newspaper and are defined by the culture within that newspaper. A recipe for cooking turkey in a newspaper is unlikely to be more or less reliable than one found in a blog, because newspapers have more exacting standards for their News section compared to their Lifestyle section.\nJournal articles are considered to meet some particularly high standards and are the gold-standard information source in many disciplines. A typical process for writing a scientific paper looks something like this (don‚Äôt worry, you probably will never do this!):\n\nAsk a new, interesting question\nDevelop answers through careful experimentation\nWrite up the results and interpret them in a paper\nEdit and re-draft the article multiple times\nSubmit the paper to a journal where it is screened for quality by an editor\nReceive reviews of the paper by at least two (anonymous) experts in the discipline\nAttempt to improve the paper by responding the reviewer comments\nHope that the editor and reviewers agree that it is worth publishing\nWait to see if researchers in the field refer to the paper in their work\n\nThis makes publishing a scientific paper very challenging. Science has a rigid system of quality control that makes its articles generally trustworthy. However, this does not mean that every paper is correct, perfect or important. Scientific articles have mistakes, but it is rare compared to other written forms. The question of how important a scientific paper is can usually not be known until several years later. If other scientists cite the work, use its methods or adopt its ideas then it has become important.\nFrequently students refer to university press releases and popular books in their writing. You need to recognise that these have not met the same quality criteria as a scientific paper. They have also been written for different reasons than merely ‚Äúreporting original findings‚Äù. I can write anything I want in a personal blog and nobody can stop me from publishing it. The reason I would write a blog might be that I want to learn something, I want to reach a new audience or I maybe I want to do something different than my day-job.\nA university press release might serve the function of showcasing a university and its excellance to the outside world, similar to an advertisement. Popular books are often not peer-reviewed like scientific papers, and often involve scientists reaching well outside their specialisation. Many popular books by scientists are deeply philosophical and contain anecdotes from their personal lives.\nAll of these sources can be useful, especially when starting to learn a topic. They can also help us to become enthusiastic about a subject that interests you. However, they rarely serve as solid foundations for your arguments.\nHere are some simple rules when choosing your sources:\n\nPopular media: good for general information and highlighting the cultural importance of an idea\nEssays and books: good for well-written summaries of ideas and clear arguments on interesting ideas\nBlogs and social media: good for developing interests and being directed to more reliable sources\nJournal articles: good for citing factual scientific information, discovering new methods and finding arguments made by scientists and philosophers\nLiterature reviews: good for a factual overview of a scientific research area and determining the relative importance of scientific findings"

    "text": "Writing and Knowing\nIt is a common misconception that if you listen to enough lectures and read enough notes you will understand your college course well enough. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Even if not everyone enjoys doing mathematics or physical exercise, it is well understood that practice is required to get better at them. Similarly, with developing scientific or philosophical understanding it is necessary to practice, and the best practice is often to write.\nMost people who write regularly are aware of the following phenomenon:\n\nI thought I had a good idea.\nThen I wrote it down and it seemed stupid.\nSo I wrote some more and figured out what I wanted to say.\n\nMany people never start writing or give up when they think their writing is stupid. For this reason, many people go on thinking they have a good idea while never actually having good ideas. One of the most common traits of creative and successful people is that they write their ideas down and develop them.\nThe software developer and start-up funder Paul Graham is famous for maintaining a blog where he writes about a range of topics. Here are some of his thoughts on writing:\n\nI think it‚Äôs far more important to write well than most people realize. Writing doesn‚Äôt just communicate ideas it generates them. If you‚Äôre bad at writing and don‚Äôt like to do it, you‚Äôll miss out on most of the ideas writing would have generated.\n\nNow consider a selection of advice given by Graham to write well:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Write Well ‚Äî excerpts from Writing, Briefly\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a bad version 1 as fast as you can\nRewrite it [version 1] over and over\nCut out everything unnecessary\nDevelop a nose for bad writing\nImitate writers you like\nExpect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong\nDon‚Äôt (always) make detailed outlines\nMull ideas over for a few days before writing\nCarry a small notebook or scrap paper with you\nWrite about stuff you like\nTry to tell the reader something new and useful\nWhen you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far\nWhen you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with\nAccumulate notes for topics you plan to cover [‚Ä¶]\nGo back and tone down harsh remarks\nPublish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas\nPrint out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen\n\n\n\nTo increase your confidence with the subjects you are studying in college, the best advice I can give you is to write about them."

    "section": "Logic and Knowing",
    "text": "Logic and Knowing\nIt is common as a student to hear that you are expected to ‚Äúthink critically‚Äù. Unfortunately for you, it is rarely explained what critical thinking actually is. In truth, critical thinking is a broad concept that has varying definitions. However, there is some broad consensus on important traits of a critical thinker.\nGenerally, to think critically requires you to be able to assess evidence and arguments. The ability to assess evidence is ‚Äî to a degree ‚Äî determined by your level of knowledge about a topic. During the course of your education at university, your scientific and statistical knowledge will increase and as will your capacity to assess evidence. The assessment of arguments is something more general and if you cannot assess arguments you might never assess evidence appropriately.\nLogic is the field of study devoted to the assessment of arguments. George Boole, UCC‚Äôs most famous professor, is primarily known for his work in logic. People regularly make basic mistakes in logic even when they protest that something is ‚Äújust common sense‚Äù.\nIn logic an argument is simply a set of premisses and a conclusion. Premisses are put forward in support of a conclusion. If the premisses are true and the conclusion follows from them then the argument itself is true.\nNote: an opinion is sometimes not an argument and usually a bad argument ‚Äî we will return to this point later.\n\nDeduction\nThe simplest kind of argument to understand is a deductive argument, a famous example being:\n\nAll people are mortal\nShane is a person\nShane is mortal\n\nHere, \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) are premisses and \\(3\\) is the conclusion. In the absence of evidence that suggests an immortal person has existed we must accept \\(1\\) is true. Similarly, as all available evidence suggests that Shane is a person then \\(2\\) is also true. Given that is is true that all people are mortal and that Shane is a person then it follows that Shane is mortal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe meaning of ‚Äúit follows‚Äù in deduction is usually understood intuitively, meaning something like ‚Äúthe mind is led to believe the conclusion based on the truth of the premisses‚Äù.\nHowever, if you are the kind of person that wants this explained then there is an underlying axiom that allows us to draw the conclusion above.\nThe axiom is transitivity and can be stated roughly as ‚ÄúIf \\(x\\) is \\(y\\) and if \\(z\\) is an \\(x\\) then \\(z\\) is also \\(y\\)‚Äù.\nTransitivity is a property of some mathematical operations (if \\(x\\) is greater than \\(y\\) and if \\(y\\) is greater than \\(z\\) then \\(x\\) is greater than \\(z\\)).\n\n\nWe can re-write the argument so that it is not valid:\n\nAll people are mortal\nShane is a person\nShane likes swimming\n\nThe conclusion here does not necessarily follow from the premisses. Usually, this does not mean that the person making the argument is incapable of thinking. Instead there is usually hidden premisses that if made explicit would render it valid:\n\nAll people are mortal\nShane is a person\nShane is mortal\nAll mortals like swimming\nShane likes swimming\n\nIn the above, the hidden premisses are made explicit, allowing us to more accurately assess the argument. Now, we have a new problem ‚Äî the new argument is not sound, which means at least one of the premisses is not true. In this case, the premise that all mortal beings enjoy swimming is not true or at least highly doubtful.\nWhen you are writing you rarely lay out arguments in numbered form like this. However, it can be good practice to map out an argument or to check your reasoning. Frequently, unstated premisses, unsound premisses and invalid arguments result in unclear and ineffective writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nLogic is a huge area. Knowledge of argument structure, validity and soundness is the bare minimum.\nThere are many other well-known examples of where people can go wrong in their reasoning.\nIt is not possible to expand on every case here, but you are encouraged to self-study in these areas if you are interested.\n\n\n\n\nInduction\nInduction is another kind of reasoning that is distinct from deduction. Thinking inductively is thought to be an important feature of science.\nWhile deduction involves a decrease in generality from universal (all) to particular (this), induction involves an increase in generality from particular (this) to universal (all).\nA famous historical example is as follows:\n\nEach swan observed has been white\nAll swans are white\n\nNote that this argument resembles the scientific proces of observing the world (1) and interpreting the results (2). In any scientific study we can only observe a sample of a population and cannot measure everything of interest. For this reason, we must go beyond the available observations to make more general statements.\nInterestingly, the above example was later demonstrated to be false. Black swans are native to other regions of the world that were not familiar to those who made the original statement.\nWe should then update our argument to the following:\n\nEach swan observed has been either white or black\nAll swans are either white or black\n\nNow, some philosophers have argued that this model of induction is problematic, because it is unclear how anyone could ever reliably go beyond particular facts to make universal statements.\nA more representative model for science is something like the following:\n\nEach swan observed within our sample was white\nThere is a high probability that all swans are white\n\nIt is then understood that scientists are not expressing certainty but rather making a statistical argument from a finite set of data.\n\n\nAbduction\nThe final form of reasoning is probably the least well known but arguably the most consistent with everyday problem-solving. Abduction involves arguments based on heuristics and approximation. When people refer to ‚Äúeducated guesses‚Äù or ‚Äúrules-of-thumb‚Äù they are typically discussing examples of abduction.\nConsider the following:\n\nMy two friends had a bad fight\nToday I saw them eating ice-cream together\nMy two friends must have made up\n\nHere we have an observation (1) and another (2). Based on the second there is a hypothesis (or ‚Äúeducated guess‚Äù) that the friends made up. It is possible that this hypothesis is wrong. For example, they could have agreed to have one last ice-cream before ending their friendship forever. However, given that people typically do not do that it would seem to be unlikely. To be a good scientist ‚Äî of course ‚Äî we should observer our two friends a little more and ask them how they are doing.\nThe real work of science usually involves abduction, when making sense of observations, proposing hypotheses, making further observations and explaining results based on models and heuristics. However, sometimes scientists use induction, especially when they have accumulated a large amount of observations and have a consistent and reliable way of explaining the results. Scientists also frequently rely on deduction as a basic kind of reasoning, for example when thinknig using scientific laws (if heat always travels from warm to cold, then this hot object will dissipate heat to its environment.)\n\n\nOpinions\nAn opinion is usually merely a conclusion with no supporting premisses:\n\nin my opinion, food should not be processed\n\nWhen justifying an opinion people often say:\n\neveryone is entitled to their opinion\n\nSo this looks something like:\n\nAll people are entitled to their opinion\nI ‚Äî a person ‚Äî am entitled to my opinion\nFood processing is bad for health\n\nThe (3) here does not follow from (1) and (2) ‚Äî by this I mean, we cannot determine whether the argument is true based on the premisses.\nFurthermore, if we assume that such arguments are valid then this allows us to affirm the truth of two contradicting statements. Assume one person argues that the world is round and another that it is flat. We can use these two ‚Äútruths‚Äù as premisses in another argument:\n\nWe know that the earth is round\nWe know that the earth is flat\nThe world is round and flat\n\nThis is not very helpful if we are in the business of determining what is true and what is false. While a fact is true, an opinion is merely held to be true by the person saying/writing it. Opinions are useful for stimulating discussions but not for making good arguments! The real substance of the above argument is completely trivial:\n\nWe know that some people believe the earth is round\nWe know that some people believe the earth is flat\nSome people believe he world is round and others that is flat\n\nBy surveying many people in a population we can determine if there is a widely-held position on something. If 60% of people think food processing is bad then we know what most people hold to be true but not whether it is true. Such a finding can motivate different actions: for example, a company might decide to reduce their emphasis on processing while another might aim to educate its consumer base on the value of processing.\nTo briefly conclude, none of the following represent compelling arguments:\n\nYour opinion, which you are entitled to\nPopular opinion, even when held by a majority\nActions taken in response to opinions, which can vary"

To judge whether this food is good or bad we would need to establish whether the combination satisfies the function. A distinction is sometimes made between natural and artificial ingredients. Natural ingredients often undergo less processing and closely resemble how they exist in nature. This sometimes means that natural natural ingredients contain higher concentrations of components like fibre. If fibre is important in this specific product, then selecting natural ingredients might be important. Otherwise fibre may need to be added.\nYes, the answer takes more words. The reason it takes more words is that when using terms like ‚Äúnatural‚Äù we have to be as clear as possible about what we intend to communicate. You cannot assume that the person who is reading your answer or listening to you speak understand what you mean.\nSo you have two options:\n\nDo not use vague words like ‚Äúnatural‚Äù\nExplain clearly what you mean by such terms"

    "text": "Thinking About Concepts\nIn science we mostly study concrete things like organisms and chemicals. Other fields, like philosophy and mathematics, sometimes study concepts or ideas directly. In science we might use a concept when studying a chemical. For example, a mathematical concept like symmetry can help us understand how two chemical isomers are related. In philosophical areas like conceptual analysis and conceptual engineering it is concepts themselves that are the object of study.\nIf you wish to use a concept like ‚Äúnatural‚Äù, or if you have an intuition that it is important, then you need to ensure you are thinking clearly about what that concept means. Typically this involves careful consideration of how it is used and the logic of sentences where it appears. In what follows we will do this with some common dichotomies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDichotomies\n\n\n\nA dichotomy consists of two concepts that are assumed to oppose each other in some way. Common examples include:\n\nGood and evil\nRight and wrong\nNatural and artificial\n\nThe kind of thinking that is characterised by such dichotomies is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúdualistic‚Äù. Dualistic thinking is rigid in that it often denies that there are ‚Äúgray areas‚Äù between the two concepts (when in reality there often is).\n\n\nThe human mind is drawn to dichotomies. Unfortunately, they are nearly always untestable. They are also typically normative and relate to values. For this reasons they do not typically guide science directly.\nHowever, they may guide design choices during the development of a comemrcial product. This is one reason why it can be useful to clarify our thinking over the terms involved.\n\nNatural and Artifical\nA great deal of dietary advice seems to center on the following notion:\n\nThere are natural foods and these are the foods we should try to eat\n\nAs food scientists then it would seem that our job should involve first-and-foremost the design of natural foods. However, if we think about the meaning of natural foods we soon find that this is difficult or impossible.\nHere are some of the ways we can think about naturalness:\n\nA thing is natural when it has not been interfered with by humans\nA thing is natural when it does not contain any chemicals\nA thing is natural when it has existed for a long time\nA thing is natural when it is legally defined as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù\n\nWe could go on and list more definitions (perhaps you can think of your own) but each of these has their own problems, especially when the definitions are linked with the following judgement:\n\nUnnatural things should be avoided\n\nTake 1. By this definition things like clothes, houses and classrooms are also unnatural. Does this mean they should be avoided also? What would it mean to have natural versions of these things? Is there some specific reason why these unnatural things are OK but unnatural foods are not?\nFor 2, we simply have a misunderstanding. Water can be considered a natural substance (it exists without human interference) but also given the chemical definition \\(H_2O\\). To add water to food is to add a chemical. Now, to be charitable to people who make this claim, what they are typically referring to is unfamiliar chemicals like citric acid. This chemical is added to achieve a specific acidity in some foods but is not known to ‚Äúthe average person‚Äù even though it is present in everyday items like lemons. As the average person can be unfamiliar with a great deal of things, it is not realistic to only create things that are familiar. For example, smart phones have not always been familiar but someone still introduced them.\n3 is an argument from tradition. It acknowledges that some things that are human-made, like houses and clothes, are important despite being artificial. However, it is argued that because people have lived in houses and worn clothes for many years then it is OK to continue to use them. What this kind of argument fails to consider is that at any point in time in the past there have been cases where a tradition was soon found to be unacceptable to the majority of people. There have been changes in norms around women‚Äôs rights and human slavery because we learned that some traditional practices were immoral. On the other hand, there have been moments in history before great discoveries ‚Äî like vaccines ‚Äî where it could not be said that a vaccine was traditional. So, arguments from tradition seem to allow us to defend bad (old) things and reject good (new) things. This should be cause for concern when using tradition to justify claims around found.\n4 is a common view among scientists, who think that we should wait until a legal definition has been supplied. Currently, however, there has been no adequate legal definition. Despite this the term is still used by scientists and marketers. It is unclear why someone would not seek to understand a term while they continue to use it. Furthermore, when such a definition is being explored experts are usually consulted, and in this case the experts might include representatives from food science and the food industry. Lastly, like the previous example, there are examples where people opt to disagree with a legal definition even if they follow the law. For example, I spend some time each year in the USA where the death penalty is legal. While I am in the USA I continue to disagree and oppose the law that permits execution. Even if a solid, legal definition for ‚Äúnatural‚Äù existed it is still within our power to disagree and seek a better definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Theorem ‚Äî Concept from Sociology\n\n\n\n\nIf people define situations or concepts as real, they are real in their consequences\n\nWhen a person or group decides something is real we can argue whether their ontology is correct. However, whether or not we agree, the decision can have real-world conseqeunces. For example, if consumers consider a processing technique to be dangerous it might be necessary for a company to stop using it, even if the consumers are factually incorrect. Of course, this is not the only option the company has: they could ‚Äî alternatively ‚Äî educate the consumers.\n\n\n\n\nPure and Dirty\nA famous definition of ‚Äúdirt‚Äù attributed to the philosopher and psychologist William James is:\n\nMatter out of place\n\nThis suggests that when it comes to dirt context is important. When red wine is in a glass it is not dirt but when it is on a piece of clothing it is dirt. What is important is that a material seems to have crossed some boundary from its right place to a wrong place. Putting together a meal then involves combining ingredients so that they taste good, but these combinations must follow certain cultural rules that do not permit some combinations. Mary Douglas, who popularised Jame‚Äôs definition, wrote extensively about the complex dietary rules that exist in some religions. For example, in the Jewish faith it is not permitted to eat pork, but it is also not permitted to mix beef and milk while cooking.\nA pure or ‚Äúclean‚Äù food then is one that only contains matter in its right place. The rules that determine what the ‚Äúright place‚Äù is are determined by culture and psychology. This creates issues for food companies who often find ingredients that are useful but that have an unclear origin to most people. Ingredients like xanthan gum and potassium sorbate are safe but are perceived as threatening the purity of foods. In other words, they are assumed to be in the wrong place. The food industry then needs to either educate the consumer about the origin and function of the ingredient or replace the ingredient with a more familiar material that provides a similar function.Even when a decision to include an ingredient is based on sound science it can fail if it does not align with cultural expectations.\nFor the scientist or engineer the definition of purity is often a more precise idea. Sugar, for example, will have a certain purity value. An imaginary \\(100%\\) pure sugar would have it purity (P) calculated as follows:\n\\[\nP \\ (\\%) = \\frac{mass \\ of \\ sugar \\ (g)}{total \\ mass \\ (g)} \\times 100\n\\]\nIn truth, very few food ingredients reach these levels of purity. Foods and food ingredients are complex systems containing multiple components that often tightly interact. The expectation for purity is lower in the food industry relative to similar industries like pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Purity Laws\n\n\n\nQuestions over the purity of food have been ongoing for centuries.\nThe introduction of purity laws in 1906 in the USA was a recognition that consumers needed to be protected from manufacturers who would adulterate foods.\nTo cut costs some manufacturers would use illegal or dangerous ingredients (formaldehyde, chalk) to increase profit.\nIn some cases these practices never returned; however, some practices once consider adulteration are being revisited due to new issues related to the environment. For example, it was once considered adulteration to use soy in meat products. Now reducing the meat content of a meat product by adding a plant-based material is considered more sustainable.\nThis is a case of a shift in context, where a new problem (climate change) has led to a practice being considered in a different light.\n\n\n\n\nFood as a ‚ÄòMessy System‚Äô\nThere are similarities between food and drugs. For example, both are consumed. Traditionally food was an aspect of medicine, with treatments involving modifications to diet. Foods are designed to have specific health effects, like yoghurts supplemented with probiotics for digestive health Some consider the gap between food and drugs to be closing, but we should consider the specific roles that food has (think: flavour, enjoyment, shared meals)\n\n\n\nFood\nDrugs\n\n\n\n\nEat always\nConsume when ill\n\n\nPersonal choice\nPrescription based\n\n\nMultiple functions\nSingle function\n\n\nNo side effects\nPotential side effects\n\n\n\nWorking food scientists often refer to food systems as ‚Äòmessy‚Äô. Food ingredients rarely approach the purity of pharmaceuticals. Food products are rarely purchased for a single reason."

    "text": "Macro and Micro Levels of Causation\nThe statement ultra-processed food is bad for public health is not necessarily incorrect but it is vague. It can be useful to think of this as a part of a larger explanation rather than a wrong explanation.\nThis statement occurs at the macro level based on loose observations and rough approximations. A scientist adds a finer level of explanation that completes the model.\nThus, ultra-processing might cause vitamin loss, which in turn leads to vitamin deficiences, that cause the public health problem. The micro and macro levels are not incompatible.\nThe problem of vagueness remains in this case, however, because the scientist working on the experiments does not know what ultra-processing is exactly. Secondly, developing this model would require collaboration between food scientists, nutritional scientists and public health specialists. This is not always possible and leads to gaps in our understanding of complex issues."
