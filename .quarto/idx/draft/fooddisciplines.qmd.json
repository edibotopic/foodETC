  |\n| Sustainability | ?   |\n\nAll of these factors - in addition to nutrients - are affected by processing.\nEffectively processing something often involves careful consideration of how these factors are affected.\n\nConversations around how to achieve nutritional or commercial goals are made far easier when there is some understanding of the challenges faced during processing.\n\nSome qualities, like freshness and sustainability, are not clearly defined and require collaborative thinking to develop a working model that fits the project context.\n\n# Business\n\n## Financial Context\n\nFood companies need to ensure they have a positive cash flow.\nThey achieve this by ensuring that their income exceeds their expenses.\n\nA food processing facility consists of a variety of components:\n\n- Raw material intake\n- Packaging material intake\n- Material handling\n- Environmental controls\n- Physical infrastructure\n\nAs food processing facilities are designed for sanitation and refrigeration the capital investment costs can be expensive.\n\nThe processing function of the facility includes:\n\n- Process equipment\n- Packaging machines\n- Ancillary devices (connections, electrics)\n- Process control equipment\n\nOperating costs include raw materials and ingredients, packaging materials, energy, utilities and labor.\n\n## Cost Optimisation\n\nIt is estimated that 70% of the costs of goods are associated with raw materials, ingredients and packaging.\nApproximately 10% relates to energy, 10% to labor and the remaining 10% to miscellaneous costs.\nFrom this it follows that cost-optimisation strategies should focus on materials.\nIt is also worth noting that market fluctuations in material costs are a major concern for manufacturers.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Effective but expensive ingredients\n\nCocoa, butter and eggs are all familiar, highly-functional ingredients.\n\nUnfortunately, they are also expensive.\nIn addition, materials like cocoa are highly volatile, with their price fluctuating with great frequency.\n\nThere is an incentive to reduce or eliminate such ingredients in formulations, but this has to be done with great care:\n\n- Customers will expect the product quality to stay the same\n- The product will need to be processed using the same equipment\n- Nutritional profile and label information may need to change\n\nThese projects involve close collaboration between the business, research and operations functions in the company.\n\n**Note**: it is far easier to do a project of this kind with a new rather than an existing product.\n\n:::\n\nCommodities are materials that have their price set by the market.\nButter, grain and milk powder sold by one company is considered as good as that sold by another.\nIt is difficult to achieve market differentiation for such materials, so producers mostly aim to increase their efficiency and volume of production.\n\nCompanies can attain high margins for novel ingredients or products that have not attained commodity status.\nFor example, cheddar cheese is a commodity and so is the whey powder obtained by drying its liquid byproduct.\nWhey protein concentrates, which have been a massive commercial success in recent years, are increasingly viewed as commodities.\nDairy companies are increasingly looking at more and more specialised fractions from whey that can be sold at higher margins.\n\nThere are a series of trade-offs here.\nSuch materials command high costs but can only be produced at small volumes.\nThe cost of producing the material may be high and require specialised equipment.\nA consumer base may not have been developed.\nIt is key in such cases that the material is produced as efficiently as possible and that — above all — it functions as it is supposed to.\n\n# Nutritional Considerations\n\nIt is important to distinguish between different kinds of outputs of a food manufacturing facility.\nHelpful categories might include:\n\n1. Products designed for a specific nutritional purpose (infant formula)\n2. Ingredients designed to have a nutritional function in a product (vitamin D)\n3. Products or ingredients with a general purpose that have a nutritional claim (high-protein yoghurt, gluten-free bread mix)\n4. Regular products that legally require a label containing a nutritional label (sliced pan)\n5. Products that have not nutritional identity or label (alcoholic drinks)\n\nWith respect to nutrition, a food process can have the following potential outcomes:\n\n- Inedible -> edible\n- Unfortified -> fortified\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"fooddisciplines.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":{"light":["../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Food Disciplines","slide-format":"revealjs"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
