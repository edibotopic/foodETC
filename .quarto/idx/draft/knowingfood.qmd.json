Reject the concept\n2. operationalise the concept\n\nFor example, if someone argues that unicorns might be healthier meat source than chickens we should probably reject the concept.\nThis is certainly a view not generally held by people and it is difficult to imagine how we might use an imaginary animal as a raw material.\nNow, a concept like \"natural food\" is viewed by some scientist as being equally as meaningless.\nIn their view, as all things are ultimately derived from nature, it does not make sense to talk of degrees of naturalness.\nHowever, the concept is widely used in society and is not necessarily imaginary in the sense of a unicorn.\nThe problem is not whether natural things are real but is instead:\n\n1. How can things be categorised as natural?\n2. What benefit is there to this categorisation?\n\nThese questions **operationalise** the problem and make it more **tractable**.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n## Operationalisation of AI\n\nA famous case of operationaliation is the Turing Test.\n\nWhen Alan Turing proposed his test it was after many years of debates concerning the question:\n\n> Can machines think?\n\nWhile Turing thought this was an interesting question he did not think it could be resolved.\n\nIn other words: it was a waste of time.\nhis test, on the other hand, was tractable:\n\n> Can a machine convince someone that it is a person?\n\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"knowingfood.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":{"light":["../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Knowing Food","slide-format":"revealjs"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
