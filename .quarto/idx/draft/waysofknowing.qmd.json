Everyone has their favourite meal. We have all been eating and drinking for most of our lives.\n\nWhat then is different about how a food scientist knows about food?\n\nA classic distinction that is useful when thinking about this question is that between two ways of knowing:\n\n- Procedural knowledge (knowing how)\n- Declarative knowledge (knowing that)\n\n### Procedural knowledge\n\nProcedural knowledge is associated with following sets of instructions.\nFor example, it is possible to cook a good meal by simply following a recipe.\nThis is not too different to mechanically following a laboratory protocol.\n\nThis way of knowing is often acquired through experience.\nSomeone may know the steps required to achieve a goal but not why the steps work.\nAn issue with this kind of knowledge is that it is difficult to teach.\nWhen asking someone why a step works they might respond \"it just works\".\nAnother problem with this is that it is relatively inflexible and when\nthe procedure is found to falter or fail it can be difficult to modify.\n\n### Declarative knowledge\n\nDeclarative knowledge is knowledge that can be expressed clearly in speech or writing.\nWhen a scientist outlines the steps in a laboratory method it is preferable if they can explain the purpose of each step.\nConsider a method with a step that involves adding a dangerous acid — a legitimate question might be:\n\n> Do we really need the step with the dangerous acid?\n\nTo answer the question we need to know what the mechanism of the acid is supposed to be.\nAlternatively we could remove the step and see if the method still works.\n\nKnowledge of how something works better enables us to explain it other people (students, employees, managers).\nIt also means that we are typically more flexible when a problem arises (there might be a non-acidic material that works the same way).\n\nThe declarative knowledge characteristic of science is usually also generalisable, meaning that once we know some set of facts about a phenomenon we are able to extend that knowledge over a wide variety of cases.\n\nAs a scientist, technologist or designer you need both procedural and declarative knowledge; however, many students think that *knowing how* is sufficient.\nThis can restrict your thinking and your career path, as it is often necessary to question that procedures that are in place, even when they have been there for a long time.\n\n### Procedural Vs. Declarative: The Case of Searing Meat\n\nA classic case that helps us explore this distinction is the searing of meat.\nIt is still common today for recipes to suggest that cooks \"sear meat\".\nThis is a common step that is followed to produce juicy meat (a procedure).\n\nWhen chefs explained why meat should be seared they suggested that it \"sealed in\" the juices.\nThis explanation is somewhat metaphorical, and is similar to the ancient surgical technique of cauterisation by burning.\nWhile effective searing does produce delicious meat it is not because juices are sealed in through the formation of a skin.\n\nHere, there is a problem with the declarative knowledge used to explain the step.\nThis knowledge is assumed uncritically, informed by metaphors and has never been tested.\nThese three reasons alone make the knowledge somewhat unscientific.\n\nRecently, scientists began to study the operation of searing.\nThey measured the loss of moisture from meat that had been seared and meat that had not.\nIt was found that searing — in fact — accelerates the loss of moisture.\n\nThese scientists knew that searing was desirable (it produced a good effect) but it was not for the reasons commonly outlined.\nInstead, they suggested that the high temperatures used during searing promoted other effects — especially Maillard browning — that were responsible for the positive attributes of seared meat.\n\nMaillard browning is a well understood chemical reaction that occurs in a wide variety of food systems.\nIn some it is undesirable (infant formula) and in others it is desirable (baked goods).\nIt is known that the effect is promoted by certain conditions (e.g., alkaline pH); hence, obvious questions emerged, such as whether changing pH could improve the quality of cooked meat.\nIn addition, scientists returned to the original stated goal of searing (sealing the juices) and wondered how this could be achieved while also promoting browning.\n\nThe answer is known as *sous vide* cooking, where meat is first cooked at low temperature in a sealed pouch before then being briefly seared.\nMost of the cooking is done in the pouch where moisture loss is minimal while the searing can still achiever the browning effect.\n\nConsidering this case a few important points to consider are:\n\n- Knowing the true mechanism of searing allowed the development of more optimal techniques\n- Scientific knowledge of the Maillard browning reaction allows us to generalise to a variety of cases\n\n\n## Reductionsim and Holism\n\nThere has been some debate in recent years about the *reductionsim* of food and nutritional science.\nCritics suggest that scientists should try to be *more holistic*.\nThese terms are often ill-defined, but from what we have just discussed we can begin to think through them.\nWe have listed four categories — matter, form, process and function.\nTo be reductionist is to emphasise one over the others at the expense of understanding the object of study.\nTo be reductionist is to seek explanations that give weighting to all four, or *at least* these four.\n\nJust like matter, form, process and function are all just different categories by which we can think about food (at different scales), we can also differentiate between kinds of reductionism that correspond to these categories. The resulting \"-isms\" might be:\n\n- **Materialism**: focusing on how the matter in food influences its properties\n- **Structuralism**: focusing on how the structure of food influences its properties\n- **Causalism**: focusing on how processing causes changes in food properties\n- **Functionalism**: focusing on the final function served by food\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nThe most prominent kind of materialism is \"nutritional reductionism\" or \"nutritionism\" for short.\n\nNutritionism is usually framed as a criticism, which suggests that scientists focus too much on nutrients while neglecting other aspects of food that are important.\n\nA central goal of this course if exploring this claim by trying to understand what food scientists actually think about.\n:::\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"waysofknowing.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":{"light":["../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Ways to Know","slide-format":"revealjs"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
