how do we define food? what ways are we convinced to buy food?).\nWhat *is required* ‚Äî above all ‚Äî is a willingness to learn new things, engage in the class and think critically.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nThese notes and slides do not provide full coverage of the course content.\n`Lectures`, `videos`, `readings`, `discussions`, `drawings` and `assessments` are just as important.\nEnrolled students are expected to participate fully in the course and write their own notes.\n:::\n\n## List of Assessments\n\nThe module involves 100% **Continuous Assessment**:\n\n- ‚úÖ Lecture attendance/participation (10 marks)\n- ‚úÖ Semester 1 class exam (20 marks)\n- Semester 2 class exam (20 marks)\n- Group presentation (20 marks)\n- Critical Essay (30 marks)\n\nFurther details on these assessments will be provided during the year.\n\n## Preface to the Module\n\nFood is both astonishingly complex and boringly familiar.\nThat there is a science of food, and that students study this at a university,\ncomes as a great surprise to some people.\nYet these same people often have many questions about their own food choices and\nhow their food is manufactured that are difficult to answer using \"common sense\".\nThe effects of diet on health, lifestyle and the environment are some of\nthe most pressing questions facing society today, and the knowledge\nof food scientists will play a key role in answering them.\n\nSome of these questions are age-old ‚Äì how can we feed a growing population? ‚Äì \nothers more contemporary ‚Äì do palatable alternatives to\nanimal-based products exist that are less harmful to the environment? \n‚Äî and some quite controversial ‚Äì should food choice be determined by \npersonalised data to prevent diet-related disease?\nA university education will not give you the answers to all of these questions, but it\nwill prepare you to begin finding the answers (or better questions).\n\nI hope you enjoy the module.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Vertical Slice\n\nLike most science degrees, each year of the BSc Food Science builds on the foundation of the previous year.\nStudents might be interested in learning about beer brewing or ice-cream manufacture from day one.\nHowever, to appreciate these topics fully one has to master more foundational material, such as:\n\n- Chemistry (year 1)\n- Food engineering (year 2)\n- Sensory science (year 3)\n\nThen in year 4 a student is considered ready to approach the full complexity of food product\nto the point that they can develop their own in a systematic fashion\n\n- Product development (year 4)\n\nThe difficulty with this approach for students is that for a long while they can feel out-of-touch with what they came to university to study (in this case `food`).\nThis module is designed as a **vertical slice** through the whole degree.\nSamples of each year, ranging from the fundamentals in year 1 to advanced topics in year 4, are found throughout.\nThe challenge with this approach is that the students have not studied the pre-requisites for the more advanced material.\nFor this reason, a somewhat philosophical approach is adopted, focusing on general concepts, case studies and critical thinking.\n\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":["theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Overview","slide-format":"revealjs"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
