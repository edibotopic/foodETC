Every day we use and make our own artifacts.\n\nAs humans, we make things that would otherwise not be found in nature: houses, furniture, containers, vehicles, weapons, tools and ‚Äî of course ‚Äî food.\nEach thing we make has a process that must be followed for it to be created.\nA process is simply a series of ordered steps that generate an output.\nEvery food, whether made in a kitchen or made in a factory, has a process.\nWhat occurs during a process, in terms of the choices made, the materials added or removed and any chemical changes that might occur influence the properties of the object.\n\n### Function\n\nA function is the end which an object is supposed to serve.\nTables are expected to support solid things without them sliding off and breaking on the floor.\nA glass is expected to hold water.\nEach of these simple objects has a well-understood function in human life and they are designed with this function in mind.\n\nFood can be thought of as having nutrition as an important function.\nHowever, it is difficult to ignore that many people consume certain foods for different purposes.\nConsider ice-cream ‚Äî for example ‚Äî which is typically consumed for pleasure alone.\nIf we design an ice-cream but ignore this fact then we are unlikely to produce a *good* ice-cream.\nThis is one way of definining what a *good food* is: a food that fulfils a well-defined function. A food can also be multi-functional.\nFor example, a protein bar is design to be 1. convenient and 2. nutritional.\nWhen evaluating whether a protein bar \"works\" we would need to evaluate it on at least these two criteria.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Functional food\n\nIn recent years the term \"functional food\" has become popular among food scientists.\n\nAs all food has a function the term seems confusing at first, but typically it is taken to mean:\n\n> A food that has a function that goes beyond the conventional functionality of a food product\n\nIn this area there are special ingredients that can impact specific aspects of how food and body interact, like how eating a probiotic food can influence the gut microbiome or how some fatty acids are linked with brain development. \n:::\n\n## The Structure of Food Science?\n\nArguably, modern food science is structured loosely around the four areas mentioned above.\n\nThere are projects focusing on:\n\n- Matter: what is the composition of a food? This kind of work is common in Quality Control roles.\nScientific papers of this type are published in journals like Food Chemistry\n- Form: what structure does a food have, such as how its molecules are arranged microscopically.\nThis work is important in Research & Development roles. Scientific papers of this kind are published in\njournals like Food Structure.\n- Process: what ways can we manufacture food effectively? This kind of work is common in Food Production roles.\nScientific papers of this kind are published in journals like Journal of Food Engineering.\n- Function: what functions do foods have technologically or biologically. This kind of work is common in a wide\nrange or roles, and usually requires collaboration with nutritional scientists when biological functions are\nbeing tested. Scientific papers of this kind are published in journals like Food & Function.\n\nIn food products these different areas intersect in complex ways.\nConsider a vitamin D-enriched nutrition beverage:\n\n|Function              |Matter                               |Form                       |Process                           |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|Delivery of vitamin   |Oil carrier, vitamin and water       |Structure of an emulsion   |Homogenisation to stabilise oil   |\n\nTo design a functioning product we need knowledge of what the product will do (its function), what ingredients we need (the matter),\nwhat structure the ingredients generate (the form) and what operations will be necessary to produce it (the process).\n\n## Structure and Reality\n\nWhat I just described in the previous section is basically a restatement of an ancient model for understanding the world attributed to Aristotle.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Aristotle\n\nAristotle is one of the most famous ancient philosophers and is considered the most influential *natural philosopher*, which was the precursor to the modern concept of the scientist.\n\nHe is known for the writing influential books on most topics you can imagine, including physics, politics, biology, psychology and astronomy.\n:::\n\nOne of the general problems that interested Aristotle was:\n\n> how can we provide good explanations?\n\nHe grew frustrated at the explanations that were being provided around him.\nWhen asked \"What is a statue?\" one would say it is a lump of stone or marble (matter), another that it was a person-shaped object (form) and another that it was the product of sculpting (process).\n\nAristotle suggested that an *exhaustive* account of a statue would have to include at least these three aspects. He also thought that the object's *telos* (Greek for end or function) is also essential to any description.\n\nSome statues were crafted to pay homage to a great citizen, others in praise of a God and others to ridicule a defeated enemy. These different functions would have to be considered when evaluating whether a given statue was a good one.\n\n<div>\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"../slides/three/\"></iframe>\n```\n</div>\n\n[üìΩÔ∏è Direct link to slides for this lecture](slides/three/)\n\n## Applying the Four Causes\n\nWhen asked the questions:\n\n- What is candy floss?\n- What is a protein supplement?\n- What is drinking milk?\n\nIt is not sufficient to answer:\n\n- A sugary snack\n- A thing used to build muscle\n- A white liquid\n\nIn each case we are simply describing food according to a single category of properties.\n\nAristotle would ask us to consider each of the four factors that cause these materials to be be what they are.\n\nFor example, consider the second case:\n\n- Matter: predominately protein, typically whey protein\n- Form: usually a powder\n- Process: spray-drying\n- Function: convenient source of protein\n\nWe now have a more full description of this material.\n\nEach aspect could be described in more detail, depending on your knowledge of the product.\n\nIn a job, you might be expected to make innovations with this product or come up with something new that will sell well.\nAs a food scientist you can make changes to one or more aspects in the hope of achieving thos goal.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nAristotle was a great thinker and continues to influence scientists, philosophers and mathemiticians today. However, there have always been those that disagree with his ideas and we must be careful not to extend them to areas where they do not work.\n\nIn ancient times the main opponents to Aristotle's views were the *atomists* who consider atoms (matter) to be sufficient to explain all things. Many years later, Francis Bacon ‚Äî considered to be the founder of the modern scientific method ‚Äî rejected the formal and final (function) causes and urged scientists to focus on matter (e.g., atoms, molecules) and process (e.g., heat, motion).\n\nA significant rejection of Aristotle's ideas occured in biology with the discovery of evolution. Aristotle would suggest that an animal had a specific *telos* that governed its development; however, evolutionary biology maintains that animals develop through random genetic mutations and natural selection.\n\nModels like the four causes are not \"scientific theories\" as we normally understand them.\nThey are *heuristics* or rules-of-thumb that guide us in our thinking.\n\nVersions of the four causes are most commonly found among **designers** who are in the business of creating clothes, buildings, software, furniture, lessons and any other thing you can imagine that people use or consume. Of course, food scientists in their own way are designers also, because they make things that people should want to eat. Many of the examples Aristotle gave in his original works were of things people made (statues, tables) rather than natural things (animals, plants).\n\nWhen using the four causes as a heuristic, it is important to keep in mind that it is most appropriate when guiding how we approach questions concerning technology (making things for people) rather than science (understanding nature) *per se*.\n:::\n\nFood products are technologies, engineered in all cases for ultimate\nconsumption by humans; any technology is a cultural artifact, which\nis shaped by, and itself shapes, culture; the designer of a technol-\nogy bears an ethical responsibility to the user of that technology. From\nthe preceding something becomes apparent ‚Äì food scientists are not\n‚Äôjust‚Äô scientists, they are often some amalgam of scientist, engineer and\ndesigner. Once we recognise the essence of what we do, we can understand better what we could do and what we should do to benefit society.\n\n# Conclusions\n\n- Any food can be explained well by describing the matter from which it is composed, its qualities and structure, the manner of its production and its range of functions\n- Such explanations are always constrained to a degree, by factors such as scale, context and audience, which need to be considered when formulating the explanation\n- This model is ontological (it structures our thinking) rather than scientific and is holistic insofar as it attempts to describe food in its entirety\n- A type of reductionism is the kind where one of these ontological categories is given primacy (e.g., materialism or functionalism)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"fourcauses.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":{"light":["../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Matter, Form, Process, Function","slide-format":"revealjs"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
