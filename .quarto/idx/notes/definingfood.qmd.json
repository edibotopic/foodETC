Despite the fact that we all eat, there is not necessarily\nuniversal agreement on what is food, what is not food and what might become food.\n\n# What Food *is*\n\nThere are generally two approaches to beginning a discussion of *what food is*.\nIn science education, there is a tendency to begin with `parts` (elements, atoms and molecules).\nIn everyday life we are more likely to begin with `qualities` (colour, aroma, wholesomeness).\nBoth approaches are legitimate but they often seem to be in conflict:\n\n> Science tells us to choose foods based on nutrients but we should really be trusting our instincts\n> — a common view among figures like Michael Pollan, who have critiqued the food industry in recent years\n\nThere is another way of talking about food that focuses on `categories`.\nA significant number of people think it is 'common sense' to opt for **natural** food.\nThis is assumed to exist in opposition to another category of the **artificial**.\nThese terms can even by found on food products manufactured by high-tech companies.\nIf we consider concepts like ’naturalness’, ’wholeness’ and ’cleanness’ to be important\nthen we need to develop our understanding of them, because their definitions are not obvious.\n\nWe must first recognise — however — that the process of thinking about these categories is **not science**.\nThis does not mean that the process is not important, but simply that it must be approached in a different way.\nLater we will see how scientists approach thinking about these problems to render them 'useful'/\n\n<div>\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"../slides/two/\"></iframe>\n```\n</div>\n\n[📽️ Direct link to slides for this lecture](slides/two/)\n\n## Seeking a definition\n\nWhen asked to define an object as seemingly *everyday* as food many students are quick to consult a dictionary.\nHere, they will generally find something like:\n\n> a material containing nutrients that when consumed provides an organism with the means to grow\n\nIs this a good definition? Most students intuitively answer 'yes'.\nHowever, when asked to describe their favourite food they will mention things like:\n\n- Sensory attributes\n- Contextual factors\n- Ingredient pairings\n- Functional properties\n\nEarlier I indicated that scientists focus on parts while non-scientists focus on qualities — this is a simplification that we will need to revisit.\nIn fact, scientists are interested in qualities but in the following specific ways:\n\n- What causes certain qualities?\n- Which qualities do people prefer?\n- How can qualities be measured?\n\nThis is a point that we will need to return to several times because it results in much confusion.\nIt is a gross simplification to claim that food scientists are only interested in what molecules are in a food and measuring their levels.\nWhen we consider that most food scientists design products for people this characterisation becomes even weaker.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Tip: don't rely on a dictionary\n\nDictionaries provide definitions for the *common usage* of terms in an **everyday** context.\n\nThe meaning of a word can change over time.\nAt a given time a word might have an imprecise meaning, or even multiple possible meanings.\nSome individuals may have a more detailed understanding of a term by --- for example --- being experts on a topic.\n\nYou are in university to develop a deeper knowledge of food than most people.\nPeople argue about food in spite of the existence of dictionary definitions.\nThese issues are not settled and we need to think about them carefully.\n:::\n\nConsider the claim:\n\n> food is a collection of nutrients\n\nIs this true?\n\n*No*.\n\nIn most cases, food necessarily contains a significant quantity of nutrients.\nHowever, it is not the case that food only contains nutrients.\n\nThe primary constituent of most foods is water, nearly all foods contain bacteria and\nthere is a broad class of other non-nutritional factors (e.g., fibres) that play a huge\nrole in determining important properties of food.\n\nFood scientists spend a lot of time and energy on the state of water in a food system.\nThe amount of water in a food is critical in determining the time it takes to rot.\nThe presence of water in specific forms — like crystals — is also important for the texture of products like ice-cream.\n\nThink about ice-cream for a moment.\nWhy do people buy ice-cream?\nUsually because they enjoy certain qualities (coldness, melting, sweetness, texture).\nWhen is ice-cream frequently served?\nAfter a meal.\n\nThe fact that ice-cream contains nutrients is secondary consideration to its sensory properties.\n\nNot all food is like ice-cream.\nSome foods — like infant formula — can be considered to serve primarily a nutritional function.\n\nHowever, most foods are selected for a wide variety of reasons (nutrition, sensory, culture, etc.).\nNarrowing our definition of food to a single class of molecules (nutrients) leads to a limited understanding of food and reduces our capacity to design foods for different individuals and contexts.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Base Needs\n\nIn primary school most of us encountered the distinction between *needs* and *wants*.\nFood is often considered a *need*, like water, rather than a *want* like a VR headset.\nAs food is needed for survival, this can lead to the view that as long as a food contributes to survival it is good.\n\nNow consider some other \"base needs\" like clothes and shelter.\nCertainly, both jackets and houses protect us from our environments.\nHowever, think about the actual place where you live or the outfit that you are wearing.\nDo you think what makes these things \"good\" is solely determined by their capacity to protect you from the environment?\nWhen you think of how your apartment could be better or what shoes you might prefer are you thinking:\n\n> How will this maximise my capacity to survive in my environment?\n\nThe answer is surely 'no' because — living in a safe, rich country — your survival is effectively ensured.\nGiven that most (though not all) people in a country like Ireland have an adequate supply of nutrients the \nquestion is rarely 'how will I have enough food to survive?' but rather 'what foods do I most desire?'.\n\n:::\n\n## Nutraloaf\n\nIn class we encountered Nutraloaf, a meal fed to prisoners as punishment.\nFrom how it is described, the food is claimed to be nutritionally complete.\nHowever, the food is otherwise bland.\n\nNutraloaf has been the subject of legal cases in the US that argue it is a Cruel and Unusual punishment.\nThe issue is interesting because nutraloaf apparently serves the function of a food (supplying nutrients).\n\nOntologically, this material seems to meet the necessary conditions for being a food but it is also in some sense inadequate.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n- A food can only be successful in supplying nutrients insofar as it is deemed edible in the first place\n- The phenomenon of 'taste fatigue' is not restricted to prisoners and is known to cause nutritional deficiencies\n- There is an increasing recognition that the structure of food influences the manner in which it digested\n- The idea that a single nutritionally complete food can be prepared for all adult males is dubious\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nWhat do you think about nutraloaf?\n\nWould you eat it?\n\nDo you think it's fair that others have to?\n\nHow is it different to commercial meal-replacers like Soylent?\n:::\n\n## Ontology\n\nFor now, we are seeking **general** ideas about food rather than particular ones.\nIf we started listing all of the particularities of food, such as redness, freshness, spiciness\nthen we would have a very long list.\nWe would throw our hands up at some point and say 'it's complicated'.\nBetter to identify some general categories so that we can organise particular properties under those categories.\nThis is what ontology involves.\n\nOntology is similar to mathematics in that it involves the abstract study of objects.\nWhen doing ontology, however, we usually try to determine what we can say about reality.\nFor most mathematicians, talking about sets or numbers does not mean that these objects exist physically.\nMathematics is neutral with respect to reality and is only concerned with mathematical objects.\n\nAt a very basic level ontology concerns two kinds of thing:\n\n1. Objects\n2. Relations\n\nFrom these simple types of things we can reason about a lot, including structures and systems.\nThe question *what is an emulsion?* is answered by considering the objects (oil and water) and the relations (the oil is dispersed in the water).\nAn emulsion is a structure that is defined as a dispersion of oil and water.\nThis structure has important properties — it can dissolve both water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, for example.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Taxonomies and Food Pyramids\n\nA *taxonomy* that you encounter in biology is a kind of ontological model.\nTypically, a taxonomy classifies objects into a hierarchy.\nThis means between any two objects there is an order ($x$ is either higher or lower than $y$).\nIn a biological taxonomy the highest level (or 'rank') is the most general while the lowest is the least general.\nPlants and animals share general attributes of Life, but a red fox and a white rose have different attributes as different Species.\n\nThe traditional food pyramid is an ontology of this kind — but objects at the lowest level (fruits, veg) are considered more foundational to the diet.\nA less common type of model is a *meronomy*, which classifies objects on the basis of parthood.\nMyPlate, a replacement for the food pyramid, consists of a meal (the whole) and its parts (fruits, grains, veg, protein, dairy).\nThis model attempts to establish what the necessary components should be for every meal.\nRevisions to the food pyramid have taken place multiple times over the decades.\nThere continues to be debate over this issue because people disagree over what factors are important when categorising food.\nFor example, increasingly there are calls to include environmental impact in such classifications.\n:::\n\nA structure is simply a set of objects and the relations that hold between them.\nMeals have a structure because some courses (main) follow other courses (starter).\nA university class has a structure because some person (lecturer) teaches other people (students).\nSystems are structures that are dynamic (they change over time).\nFor simplicity, we often think of systems as fixed (into systems) but most are in flux.\n\nA key concept when defining any system (or sub-system) is the system boundary.\nIt is not possible for us to think about everything, so we usually have to draw a boundary around the system we are interested in.\nFor example, a latte is a hot coffee beverage containing caffeine and milk that is slightly bitter and has a strong aroma.\nWe can draw a boundary around to the coffee so that we can study it as a mixture of water, caffeine and milk components.\nIn reality, however, the system is more complex.\nThe coffee beans were harvested in Africa, the coffee was extracted by the barista, the aroma and taste are experienced by the customer.\nA full ontology of this system would account for all of these objects and relations.\nIn practice, we often have to narrow the scope of inquiry but this does not mean that the factors we have excluded do not exist.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nA possible issue in the nutraloaf case is that the relation between the food and the prisoner is not considered seriously.\nThe food is nutritionally complete (for argument's sake) but many prisoners do not want to eat it.\nDefending nutraloaf on the basis that it provides nutrients does not account for the fact that people need to desire foods in order to acquire their nutrients.\nFor nutraloaf to function as a food it must also be acceptable to prisoners (it evidently is not).\n\nThe idea is that the punishment works by depriving the prisoner of enjoyment (sensory blandness) while ensuring they remain healthy (nutritional completeness).\nHowever, enjoying food and being nourished by food are tightly coupled (we eat the things we want to eat).\n:::\n\nFood scientists in nearly all cases must consider how the product relates to the consumer.\nThe chemical interaction between coffee and milk might be important because it affects the consumer experience.\nOften we have to be specific about this: perhaps the bitterness of the coffee is reduced by the presence of milk.\n\nIn recent times, food scientists have needed to expand their boundaries even further, especially in the context of sustainability.\nFor example, the working conditions for the coffee supplier might need to be considered.\nIn addition, the environmental impact of the milk source might be important.\nThus, the range of objects we consider and how they relate in the system we are studying can become narrower or borader depending on the context of the problem.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nIt is always wise to question our ontological models.\nSince ancient times thinkers have constructed taxonomies that suggest men are higher beings than women.\nMost of us now (rightly) reject this idea.\n\nWhile less controversial, the designers of MyPlate's decision to distinguish a class called \"protein\"\n(normally considered as a nutrient) from other classes (which are all categories of food) should attract\nour attention:\n\n> what is \"protein\" supposed to represent as a food group?\n\n:::\n\n## Ontology and Science\n\n*What is the difference between science and ontology?*\nLike most areas of knowledge there is some overlap.\nOne of the easiest (but not uncontroversial) distinctions is that scientific problems are usually\n*testable* while ontological problems can only be dealt with through *reasoning*.\nMany important scientific questions start, however, as ontological problems.\nPhilosophers thought about atoms centuries before it was possible to determine scientifically if they existed.\n\nOntological reductionism is the view that any structure of system can be described by reference to its parts.\nFor example, to describe what water is it is sufficient to know about the objects (individual water molecules).\nA scientist might have this ontological assumption about the world and it will likely influence the focus of their work.\nThey may — for example — focus on isolating molecules to understand their properties separate from the bulk.\nHowever, this kind of reductionism is usually not sufficient to describe a system well.\nFor example, there are forces that act between water molecules and there are social bonds that occur between people.\nAttempting to describe the behaviour of water or crowds by focusing on isolated molecules or individuals will not lead to good explanations.\n\nIt is also important to understand that molecules can interact to produce qualities that individual molecules do not possess.\nSugars interact to form crystals.\nProteins and sugars interact to generate brown pigments.\nPolysaccharides and water interact to increase viscosity.\nFor this reason alone most food scientists are not ontological reductionists — they do not think knowledge of molecules is sufficient to understand food.\nAt a minimum, most food scientist consider molecules and the relations that hold between them:\nhow these molecules interact, what influence they have on each other and how they form structures.\n\n## Ontology and Nature\n\nIn the case of food, asking 'what is a natural food?' does not have an obvious scientific answer.\nIt is a matter of how we 'carve up' the world into categories so we can mentally process the complexity of the world.\nThis involves ontological reasoning that is implicit (done unconsciously and assumed to be true without question):\n\n- There are natural things and artificial things\n- People are separate from nature \n- Artificial things are made by people\n\nAssuming this is true, many of the things that we value are artificial (furniture, houses, clothing, careers, education, meals).\nMost people use words like 'natural' and 'artificial' to describe the world.\nIt is useful, for example, to look at an unspoiled beach and say it is 'natural' and a skate park and say it is 'artificial'.\nSome problems arise when the distinction is used as a basis to make judgements about what is good and bad.\nThis is because both categories are sufficiently broad that they each encompasses good and bad things:\n\n- Natural and good: the alcoholic drink known as 'wine' that is generated when grapes are allowed to ferment\n- Natural and bad: the anion oxalate that forms a variety of salts in plant-based foods and is associated with gout and kidney stones\n- Artificial and good: synthetic vanillin used in the production of 99% of the world's vanilla-flavoured products\n- Artificial and bad: *trans* fats produced by the industrial process of hydrogenation that is known to have negative health effects\n\nThe assumption that natural things are always good (or bad) is false but so is the assumption that artificial things are always bad (or good).\nIt is preferable therefore in all such cases to <u>be more precise</u>.\nFor example, the following statement is productive:\n\n> *trans* fats are bad because of their role in contributing to poor cardiovascular health\n\nHowever, the next one is overly general and misleading:\n\n> people should avoid all artificial foods because they are bad for your health\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Visions\n\nRomanticism is a view that life was better when there was less technology and people were closer to nature.\nIt assumes that life was better in the past despite evidence to the contrary (e.g., average life expectancy was lower).\n\nUtopianism is a view that life will be better in the future once we have adopted more and better technologies.\nIt assumes that the introduction of new technology always yields a positive outcome despite counter-examples (e.g., hydrogenation was a failed technology with respect to human health).\n\nBoth of these ways of thinking are visions and are not based on evidence or sound reasoning.\nAgain, we can benefit here from thinking of particular cases.\n\nFor example: \n\n- What specific traditional practice from the past might be useful today and why?\n- What specific future technology might be useful and why?\n\n3D printing is an exciting technology but it is not 'destined' to succeed merely because it is new.\n\n:::\n\n## Operationalisation\n\nWe have already seen that ontological concepts like 'naturalness' are not scientific.\nWhat this means is that they do not emerge from doing science and they are not testable scientifically.\nNonetheless, it is not uncommon to hear scientists refer to such concepts.\n\nIn biomimetics it is assumed that there are natural structures that have specific properties that can be useful.\nScientists can then study them and design nature-inspired materials that benefit from these useful properties.\nFor example, given the problem of designing a meat-replacer we can first study the structure of meat so that the structure can be replicated.\n\nThis is an example of operationalisation, where an abstract concept is made more testable or actionable.\nHere, scientists are not concerned with the (philosophical) question of whether natural things exist.\nThey also do not make the universal (ontological) claim that natural things are better. \nInstead, the category of natural things is assumed to exist, some of those things are studied to determine their properties and attempts are made to recreate those useful properties in artificial systems.\n\nNote: in such cases it might be useful to start with an abstract idea, as long as it can be transformed into a more concrete one.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n## Objects and Relations\n\nAs an abstract study, ontology can be applied to many different cases:\n\n- A family is a set of people (objects) with an ancestry and/or affinity (relations)\n- A meal consists of a combination of ingredients (objects) that are edible to people (relation)\n- A sentence consists of characters (objects) that can be combined according to syntax rules (relation)\n- A mathematical formula consists of symbols like numbers (objects) and operators like addition (relations)\n- A diet consists of quantities of specific foods (objects) that satisfy some dietary goals (relations)\n\nThe definitions above have been *stipulated* by me and you might disagree.\nFor example, you might think that a better account of a meal would include:\n\n- Additional objects (cutlery, plates, courses, drinks, dinner guests, the price)\n- Additional relations (order of courses, food-drink pairings, comfort with setting, familiarity between people)\n\nWhen doing ontology it is possible (in theory) to reach for a full account of a system.\nOften in science we must draw a boundary somewhere to make the problem tractable.\n:::\n\n# Conclusions\n\n- Food is a set of components that exist in a structure, which has been prepared to benefit humans through a variety of functions\n- The choice to consume a food is influenced by personal needs and desires, as well as social and cultural factors\n- Not every question about food can be resolved scientifically (e.g., ontological questions, ethical problems, design aesthetics)\n- Reductionists think of a thing is the set of its parts, holists consider wholes as primary and systemists consider inter-related sub-systems\n- Ontological reductionism is rarely a feature of how scientists think (this is a common misconception)\n\n```{ojs}\n\nmd`---`\n\nmd`***Ontologically, most systems can be described as a set of: ***`\n\nmcq = [\n  {name: \"objects and relations\", mark:
